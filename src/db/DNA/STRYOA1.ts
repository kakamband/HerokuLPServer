Welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:20,580\nMy name is Ernest Borgnine and we're going to be reading a book today called \"The Rainbow Fish\" by Marcus Pfister.\n\n3\n00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,500\nAll right. Here we go.\n\n4\n00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,640\nA long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish.\n\n5\n00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:40,920\nNot just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean.\n\n6\n00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:50,760\nHis scales were every shade of blue and green and purple, with sparkling silver scales among them.\n\n7\n00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,100\nOh, beautiful.\n\n8\n00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,780\nThe other fish were amazed at his beauty. They called him Rainbow Fish.\n\n9\n00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,550\n\"Come on, Rainbow Fish,\" they would call.\n\n10\n00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,690\n\"Come and play with us!\"\n\n11\n00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:15,940\nBut the Rainbow Fish would just glide past, proud and silent, letting his scales shimmer.\n\n12\n00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:25,620\nOne day, a little blue fish followed after him. \"Rainbow Fish,\" he called,\n\n13\n00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:35,440\n\"Wait for me! Please give me one of your shiny scales. They are so wonderful and you have so many.\"\n\n14\n00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,790\n\"You want me to give you one of my special scales? Who do you think you are?\" cried the Rainbow Fish.\n\n15\n00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,520\n\"Get away from me!\"\n\n16\n00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,950\nShocked, the little blue fish swam away.\n\n17\n00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,050\nHe was so upset, he told all his friends of what had happened.\n\n18\n00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,049\nFrom then on, no one would have anything to do with the Rainbow Fish.\n\n19\n00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,000\nThey turned away when he swam by.\n\n20\n00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,420\nWhat good were the dazzling, shimmering scales with no one to admire them?\n\n21\n00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:20,259\nNow he was the loneliest fish in the entire ocean.\n\n22\n00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:25,309\nOne day, he poured out his troubles to the starfish.\n\n23\n00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:30,339\n\"I really am beautiful, why doesn't anybody like me?\"\n\n24\n00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,500\n\"I can't answer that for you,\" said the starfish. \"But if you go beyond the coral reef\n\n25\n00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:45,580\nto a deep cave, you will find the wise octopus. Maybe she can help you.\"\n\n26\n00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:52,840\nThe Rainbow Fish found the cave. It was very dark inside and he couldn't see anything.\n\n27\n00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,789\nAnd then suddenly two eyes caught him in their glare and the octopus emerged from the darkness.\n\n28\n00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:07,340\n\"I have been waiting for you,\" said the octopus with a deep voice.\n\n29\n00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,320\n\"The waves have told me your story. This is my advice.\n\n30\n00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:24,280\nGive a glittering scale to each of the other fish. You will no longer be the most beautiful fish in the sea,\n\n31\n00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,580\nbut you will discover how to be happy.\n\n32\n00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:37,520\n\"I, I can't... \" the Rainbow Fish started to say, but the octopus had already disappeared into a dark cloud of ink.\n\n33\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,840\nGive away my scales? My beautiful, shining scales? Never.\n\n34\n00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,080\nHow could I ever be happy without them?\n\n35\n00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,689\nSuddenly, he felt the light touch of a fin. The little blue fish was back!\n\n36\n00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:04,939\n\"Rainbow Fish, please, don't be angry. I just want one little scale.\"\n\n37\n00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:16,500\nThe Rainbow Fish wavered. Only one very very small shimmery scale, he thought.\n\n38\n00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,200\nWell, maybe I wouldn't miss just one.\n\n39\n00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,220\nCarefully, the Rainbow Fish pulled out the smallest scale and gave it to the little fish.\n\n40\n00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,840\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you very much!\" the little blue fish bubbled playfully\n\n41\n00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,220\nas he tucked the shiny scale among his blue ones.\n\n42\n00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,300\nA rather peculiar feeling came over the Rainbow Fish.\n\n43\n00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:54,300\nFor a long time, he watched the little blue fish swim back and forth with his new scale glittering in the water.\n\n44\n00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,440\nThe little blue fish whizzed through the ocean with his scale flashing,\n\n45\n00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:04,389\nso it didn't take long before the Rainbow Fish was surrounded by the other fish.\n\n46\n00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,079\nEveryone wanted a glittering scale.\n\n47\n00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:17,569\nThe Rainbow Fish shared his scales left and right. And the more he gave away, the more delighted he became.\n\n48\n00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:27,580\nWhen the water around him filled with glimmering scales, he at last felt at home among the other fish.\n\n49\n00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,960\nFinally the Rainbow Fish had only one shining scale left.\n\n50\n00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:43,240\nHis most prized possessions had been given away, and yet he was very happy.\n\n51\n00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,180\n\"Come on, Rainbow Fish,\" they called, \"Come and play with us!\"\n\n52\n00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,300\n\"Here I come!\" said the Rainbow Fish\n\n53\n00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,020\nand, happy as a splash, he swam off to join his friends.\n\n54\n00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:14,580\nThat wonderful? That's called \"The Rainbow Fish,\" by Marcus Pfister, okay.",

When you open your hand and wash your food,\n\n42\n00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:54,791\nI promise you the kiss will stick.”\n\n43\n00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:58,631\nChester loved his Kissing Hand.\n\n44\n00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:03,471\nNow he knew his mother’s love would go with him wherever he went. \n\n45\n00:03:03,571 --> 00:03:05,551\nEven to school.\n\n46\n00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:12,751\nAnd that night, Chester stood in front of his school and looked thoughtful. \n\n47\n00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:17,911\nSuddenly, he turned to his mother and grinned.\n\n48\n00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,011\n“Give me your hand,” he told her.\n\n49\n00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,131\nChester took his mother’s hand in his own \n\n50\n00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:29,111\nand unfolded her large, familiar fingers into a fan. \n\n51\n00:03:29,151 --> 00:03:34,511\nNext, he leaned forward and kissed the center of her hand.\n\n52\n00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:37,871\n“Now you have a Kissing Hand, too,” he told her. \n\n53\n00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:41,911\nAnd with a gentle “Good-bye” and “I love you,” \n\n54\n00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:45,431\nChester turned and danced away.\n\n55\n00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:50,651\nMrs. Raccoon watched Chester scamper across a tree limb and enter school. \n\n56\n00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:53,611\nAnd as the hoot owl rang in the new school year,\n\n57\n00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:56,654\nshe pressed her left hand to her cheek and smiled. \n\n58\n00:03:57,011 --> 00:04:02,131\nThe warmth of Chester’s kiss filled her heart with special words.\n\n59\n00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:07,511\n“Chester loves you,” it sang. “Chester loves you.”\n\n60\n00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:08,711\nI LOVE YOU\n\n61\n00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:14,771\nThe Kissing Hand . . .",

her.\n\n109\n00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:31,600\nChester and Wilson taught Lilly hand signals.\n\n110\n00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,000\nAnd she taught them how to pop wheelies.\n\n111\n00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,630\nLilly taught Chester and Wilson how to talk backwards\n\n112\n00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,000\n\"I Ma Nosliw\"\n\n113\n00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,590\nOlleh\n\n114\n00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,900\nAnd they taught her how to double-knot her shoes.\n\n115\n00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,000\n\"Some days I can't tell those three apart,\" said Lilly's mother.\n\n116\n00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,910\n\"Me either,\" said Lilly's father.\n\n117\n00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,700\nChester and Wilson and Lilly, Lilly and Wilson and Chester.\n\n118\n00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,500\nThat's the way it was.\n\n119\n00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,800\nFor Halloween, they dressed as The Three Blind Mice.\n\n120\n00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,500\nFor Christmas, Lilly gave Chester and Wilson nifty disguises.\n\n121\n00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,700\nAnd they gave her a box full of multi-colored shoelaces-- \nextra long for double-knotting.\n\n122\n00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,969\nThey loved to go on picnics.\n\n123\n00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:32,700\nWhen Chester and Wilson told Lilly about how they had\neach swallowed a watermelon seed once,\n\n124\n00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000\nLilly swallowed three of them.\n\n125\n00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,660\n\"I'll grow a watermelon plant for each of us,\" she said.\n\n126\n00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,600\nIn spring, Chester and Wilson and Lilly shared the same umbrella.\n\n127\n00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,500\nIn winter, they never threw snowballs at each other.\n\n128\n00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,520\nIn fall, they raked leaves together.\n\n129\n00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,000\nAnd in summer, they reminded each other\nto wear sunscreen so they wouldn't burn.\n\n130\n00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,000\nChester and Wilson and Lilly,\n\n131\n00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,800\nLilly and Wilson and Chester.\n\n132\n00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,300\nThat's the way it was.\n\n133\n00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,800\nAnd then Victor moved into the neighborhood...\n\n134\n00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,100\nSo Vanessa, what did you think?\n\n135\n00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,000\nI think that Victor, Lilly, Chester and Wilson\n\n136\n00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,700\nare going to have a great time\ngrowing watermelons inside of themselves.\n\n137\n00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,339\nI agree.  I think the four of them\nwill be good friends.",

Clark loved his life.\n\n11\n00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,760\n“SCHOOL IS AWESOME!” shouted Clark the Shark.\n\n12\n00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,580\n“Less shouting, more reading,” said Mrs. Inkydink.\n\n13\n00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,620\n\"LUNCHTIME IS SWEEEEET!\" yelled Clark the Shark.\n\n14\n00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,180\n\"Munch your own lunch,\" said his best friend, Joey Mackerel.\n\n15\n00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,100\n\"RECESS ROCKS!\" bellowed Clark the Shark.\n\n16\n00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,720\n\"You are playing too rough, Clark!\" cried the other kids.\n\n17\n00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,200\nYes, Clark loved his life with all of his sharky heart.\n\n18\n00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,440\nBut he loved everything way too much.\n\n19\n00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,900\nHe was too loud. \nHe was too wild.\n\n20\n00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:44,440\nHe was just too much shark for the other fish to handle.\n\n21\n00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,940\nAfter a while, no one would play with Clark. No one ate lunch with Clark.\n\n22\n00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,300\nNo one sat with him at circle time. Even his best friend, Joey Mackerel, said,\n\n23\n00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,760\n“Cool your jets, Clark! You’re making me crazy!”\n\n24\n00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,960\nOne day, Clark asked Mrs. Inkydink, “What’s wrong with everyone?”\n\n25\n00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,360\nMrs. Inkydink patted his fin.\n\n26\n00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:13,080\n“Clark, sometimes you play too hard, you munch too hard, and —gosh— you even help too hard.”\n\n27\n00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,360\n“But life is SO exciting!” said Clark.\n\n28\n00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,240\n“There’s a time and a place for everything,” said Mrs. Inkydink.\n\n29\n00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,580\n“And sometimes the rule is stay cool.”\n\n30\n00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,360\nAt recess, Clark tried to stay cool, but he pushed the swing with too much zing!\n\n31\n00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,380\n“Sorry,” said Clark. “I forgot.”\n\n32\n00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,540\n“Yikes!” cried Joey Mackerel.\n\n33\n00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,880\nAt lunch, Clark tried to stay cool, but everything smelled so good that he munched a bunch of lunches.\n\n34\n00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,700\n“Sorry,” said Clark. “I forgot.”\n“We’re STARVING!” said his friends.\n\n35\n00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,000\nIn class, Clark tried to stay cool, but a good book got him all shook up.\n\n36\n00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,880\n“Now, Clark!” said Mrs. Inkydink. “This isn’t the time or the place. Tell me, what’s the rule?”\n\n37\n00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,020\n“Stay cool,” said Clark.\n“Hey, that rhymes!” he cried.\n\n38\n00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,060\nThen Clark got a big idea in his sharky head.\n\n39\n00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,800\nMaybe if I make a rhyme, I’ll remember every time! he thought.\n\n40\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,800\nThe next day, he put his plan to work.\n\n41\n00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800\nIn class, when lessons got exciting, Clark wanted to bounce up out of his seat.\n\n42\n00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,800\nInstead, he told himself: “When teacher’s talking, don’t go walking.”\n\n43\n00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,620\nAnd what do you know? It worked!\n\n44\n00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,300\n“Attaboy, Clark!” said Mrs. Inkydink. Clark smiled. “Lessons are fun!”\n\n45\n00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,020\nAt lunch, everything smelled sooo yummy.\n\n46\n00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,300\nWhen Clark wanted to eat and eat and never stop, he told himself: “Only munch your own lunch.”\n\n47\n00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,040\nAnd it worked again!\n“Way to go, Clark!” said his friends.\n\n48\n00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,760\nClark grinned. “Lunch is fun.”\n\n49\n00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,340\nAt playtime, Clark told himself: “Easy does it, that’s the way.\n\n50\n00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,100\n“Then my friends will let me play.”\n\n51\n00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,200\nAnd playtime was fun. Once more, Clark loved his life.\n\n52\n00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,100\nBut then a shadow fell across the playground—\n\n53\n00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,640\na gi-normous shadow with tentacles galore.\n\n54\n00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,640\n“It’s a new kid, and he looks scary!” cried Joey Mackerel. “Swim for your lives!”\n\n55\n00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,500\nThe squid squashed the slide, and it snapped off the swings.\n\n56\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,860\n“Oops. My bad,” said the new kid.\n\n57\n00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,760\n“Wait,” said Clark. “He just wants to play. Let’s find a way!”\n\n58\n00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,440\nAnd he swam at the new kid with all his might.\n\n59\n00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,900\nClark played harder than he ever had before— \nupsy-downsy and spinna-ma-jig.\n\n60\n00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,880\nWhy, he even made up a new game: tail-whump-a-lumpus!\n\n61\n00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,120\n“Wow, that was fun,” said the new kid breathlessly, and he settled down.\n\n62\n00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,500\n“If you want to come to school, you’ve got to stay cool,” said Clark.\n\n63\n00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,280\n“That’s right, Clark,” said Mrs. Inkydink.\n\n64\n00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,880\n“And thanks for taking care of our new classmate, Sid the Squid.”\n\n65\n00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,000\n“Hooray for Clark the Shark!” everyone cheered.\n\n66\n00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,600\nThat night Clark’s mother asked, “What did you learn at school, dear?”\n\n67\n00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,340\n“There’s a time and a place for everything,” Clark said.\n\n68\n00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,000\n“Sometimes you stay cool.”\n\n69\n00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,680\n“But sometimes a shark’s gotta do what a shark’s gotta do.”\n\n70\n00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,260\nThe end.\n\n71\n00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,340\nThat was Clark the Shark everybody.\n\n72\n00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,060\nI think it speaks to all of us.\n\n73\n00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,080\nIt talks about how we all want to do what we want to do , right?\n\n74\n00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,060\nWe want to be ourselves.\n\n75\n00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360\nand we want to yell when we want to yell and play and laugh and have a good time.\n\n76\n00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,580\nBut as Mrs. Inkydink said, there's a time and a place for everything.\n\n77\n00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,660\nAnd there is a time and a place to be considerate of other people's feelings.\n\n78\n00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,900\nI think the lesson is: Be considerate.\n\n79\n00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,860\nThank you so much for watching Storyline Online.\n\n80\n00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,780\nMake sure to check out all of the other stories.\n\n81\n00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,780\nKeep watching and keep reading.\n\n82\n00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,260\nyou",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:16,980\nHello, I'm Robert Guillaume and welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,500\nToday we're going to be reading a story by Chih-Yuan Chen called Guji Guji.\n\n3\n00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,400\nAn egg was rolling on the ground.\n\n4\n00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:32,540\nIt rolled through the trees.\n\n5\n00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,030\nIt rolled across the meadow.\n\n6\n00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,640\nIt rolled all the way down the hill.\n\n7\n00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,870\nFinally, it rolled right into a \nduck's nest.\n\n8\n00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,120\nMother Duck didn't notice. (She was reading.)\n\n9\n00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,900\nSoon enough, the eggs began to crack.\n\n10\n00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:03,930\nThe first duckling to hatch had blue spots. Mother Duck called him Crayon.\n\n11\n00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,320\nThe second duckling had brown stripes. \"Zebra,\" Mother Duck decided.\n\n12\n00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,680\nThe third duckling was yellow, and Mother Duck named him Moonlight.\n\n13\n00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,730\nA rather odd-looking duckling hatched from the fourth egg.\n\n14\n00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,520\n\"Guji Guji,\" he said, and that became his name.\n\n15\n00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:39,700\nMother Duck taught her four ducklings how to swim, how to dive and how to waddle.\n\n16\n00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,140\nGuji Guji always learned more quickly than the others, He was bigger and stronger, too.\n\n17\n00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,260\nBut no matter how quick they were, or what they looked like, Mother Duck loved all her ducklings the same.\n\n18\n00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:09,820\nThen one terrible day, three crocodiles came out of the lake. They looked a lot like Guji Guji.\n\n19\n00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:23,139\nThe crocodiles were smiling, and when they laughed with their mouths wide open, the whole world could see their big, pointed teeth.\n\n20\n00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,080\nThe three crocodiles saw Guji Guji and smiled some more.\n\n21\n00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,620\n\"Look at that ridiculous crocodile. He's walking like a duck!\"\n\n22\n00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:42,760\nGuji Guji heard them. \"I am not walking like a duck, I am a duck!\" he explained.\n\n23\n00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:52,979\nThe crocodiles laughed. \"Look at yourself! No feathers, no beak, no big webbed feet!\n\n24\n00:02:52,979 --> 00:03:05,599\nWhat you have is blue-gray skin, sharp claws, pointed teeth and the smell of bad crocodile. You're just like us.\"\n\n25\n00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:17,909\nThe first crocodile said, \"Your blue-gray body lets you hide under water without being seen so you can get close to fat, delicious ducks.\"\n\n26\n00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:28,379\nThe second crocodile said, \"Big, sharp claws help you hold fat, delicious ducks tightly so they don't get away.\"\n\n27\n00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:39,589\nThe third crocodile said, \"Pointed teeth are necessary so you can chew fat, delicious ducks. Mmmm. Yum.\"\n\n28\n00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:45,319\nThe three crocodiles grinned. \"We know you live with the ducks.\n\n29\n00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:53,489\nTake them to the bridge tomorrow and practice diving. We'll wait underneath with our mouths open wide.\"\n\n30\n00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,460\n\"Why would I do that?\" Guji Guji asked. \"Why should I listen to you?\"\n\n31\n00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,800\n\"Because we are all crocodiles, and crocodiles help each other.\"\n\n32\n00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,100\nThe bad crocodiles grinned again and vanished into the grass.\n\n33\n00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,600\nGuji Guji felt terrible. He sat by the lake to think.\n\n34\n00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,580\n\"Is it true? Am I a bad crocodile too?\"\n\n35\n00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,889\nHe looked down into the lake and a made a fierce face.\n\n36\n00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:39,900\nGuji Guji laughed. He looked ridiculous. \"I am not a bad crocodile.
