		"text"		: "Now, the VOA Special English program AMERICAN STORIES.\nOur story today is called “A Piece of Red Calico.” It was written by Frank Stockton. Stockton was a popular writer in the second half of the nineteenth century. He wrote a large number of stories for children and other stories for adults. His most famous work, \"The Lady, or the Tiger?,\" can also be heard in VOA Special English. Now, here is Steve Ember with Frank Stockton's \"A Piece of Red Calico.\"\nI was going to town one morning when my wife gave me a little piece of red calico cloth. She asked me if I would have time, during the day, to buy her two and a half meters of calico cloth like that. I told her that it would be no trouble at all. Putting the piece of brightly colored cloth in my pocket, I took the train to the city.\nDuring the day, I stopped in at a large store. I saw a man walking the floor and asked him where I could see some red calico.\n\"This way, sir.\" And he led me up the store. \"Miss Stone,\" said he to a young woman, \"show this gentleman some red calico.\"\n\"What kind of red do you want?\" asked Miss Stone.\nI showed her the little piece of calico cloth that my wife had given me. She looked at it and gave it back to me. Then she took down a great roll of cloth and spread it out on the counter.\n\"Why, that isn't the right kind of red!\" said I.\n\"No, not exactly,\" said she; \"but it looks nicer than your sample.\"\n\"That may be,\" said I, \"but, you see, I want it to look like this piece. There is something already made of this kind of calico which needs to be enlarged or fixed or something. I want some calico of the same shade.\"\nThe girl made no answer, but took down another roll of cloth.\n\"That's the right color,\" said she.\n\"Yes,\" I answered, \"but it is striped.\"\n\"Stripes are worn more than anything else in calicoes,\" said she.\n\"Yes, but this isn't to be worn,” I said. “It's for a piece of furniture, I think. At any rate, I want perfectly plain material, to go with something already in use.\"\n\"Well, I don't think you can find it perfectly plain unless you get Turkey red,\" she said.\n\"What is Turkey red?\" I asked.\n\"Turkey red is perfectly plain in calicoes,\" she answered.\n\"Well, let me see some.\"\n\"We haven't any Turkey red calico left,\" she said, \"but we have some very nice plain calicoes in other colors.\"\n\"I don't want any other color. I want cloth to go with this.\"\n\"It's hard to find low-cost calico like that,\" she said. And so I left her.\nI next went into a store a few doors up the street. I gave a salesman my sample, and asked:\"Have you any calico like this?\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" said he. \"Third counter to the right.\"\nI went to the third counter to the right. A man there looked at my sample on both sides. Then he said: \"We haven't any of this.\"\n\"I was told you had,\" said I.\n\"We had it, but we're out of it now. You'll get that from an upholsterer, someone who recovers furniture.”\nI went across the street to the upholsterer's store.\n\"Have you anything like this?\" I asked.\n\"No,\" said the man, \"we haven't. Is it for furniture?\"\n\"Yes,\" I answered.\n\"Then Turkey red is what you want.\"\n\"Is Turkey red just like this?\" I asked.\n\"No,\" said he, \"but it's much better.\"\n\"That makes no difference to me,\" I said. \"I want something just like this.\"\n\"But they don't use that for furniture,\" he said.\n\"I should think people could use anything they wanted for furniture,\" I said, somewhat sharply.\n\"They can, but they don't,\" he said, calmly. \"They don't use red like that. They use Turkey red.\"\nI said no more, but left. The next place I visited was a very large store. Of the first salesman I saw, I asked if they sold red calico like my sample.\n\"You'll find that on the second floor,\" said he.\nI went up the steps. There I asked a man: \"Where will I find red calico?\"\n\"In the far room to the left. Over there.\" And he pointed to a distant corner.\nI walked through the crowds of purchasers and salespeople, and around the counters and tables filled with goods, to the far room to the left. When I got there I asked for red calico.\n\"The second counter down this side,\" said the man. I went there and produced my sample.\n\"Calicoes are downstairs,\" said the man.\n\"They told me they were up here,\" I said.\n\"Not these plain goods. You'll find them downstairs at the back of the store, over on that side.\"\nI went downstairs to the back of the store. \"Where will I find red calico like this?\" I asked.\n\"Next counter but one,\" said the man, walking with me in the direction he pointed out.\n\"Dunn, show this man red calicoes.\" Mr. Dunn took my sample and looked at it.\n\"We haven't this shade in that quality of goods,\" he said.\n\"Well, do you have it in any quality of goods?\" I asked.\n\"Yes; we've got it finer.\" And he took down a piece of calico, and unrolled a meter or two of it on the counter.\n\"That's not this shade,\" I said.\n\"No,\" said he. \"It is finer and the color is better.\"\n\"I want it to match this,\" I said.\n\"I thought you didn’t care about the match,\" said the salesman. \"You said you didn't care for the quality of the goods. You know you can't match goods unless you take into consideration quality and color both. If you want that quality of goods in red, you ought to get Turkey red.\"\nI did not think it necessary to answer this comment, but said: \"Then you've got nothing like this?\"\n\"No, sir. But perhaps they may have it in the upholstery department on the sixth floor.\" So I got in the elevator and went to the sixth floor.\n\"Have you any red material like this?\" I said to a young man.\n\"Red material? Upholstery department -- other end of this floor.\"\nI went to the other end of the floor. \"I want some red calico,\" I said to a man.\n\"Furniture goods?\" he asked.\n\"Yes,\" said I.\n\"Fourth counter to the left.\"\nI went to the fourth counter to the left, and showed my sample to a salesman. He looked at it, and said, \"You'll get this down on the first floor -- calico department.\"\nI went down in the elevator, and out on the street. I was completely sick of red calico.\nBut I decided to make one more effort.\nMy wife had bought her red calico not long before, and there must be some to be had somewhere. I should have asked her where she got it. But I thought a simple little thing like that could be bought anywhere.\nI went into another large store. As I entered the door, a sudden nervousness took hold of me. I just could not take out that piece of red calico again. If I had had any other kind of a cloth, I think I would have asked them if they could match that.\nBut I stepped up to a young woman and presented my sample, with the usual question.\n\"Back room, counter on the left,\" she said. I went there.\n\"Have you any red calico like this?\" I asked the saleswoman.\n\"No, sir,\" she said, \"but we have it in Turkey red.\"\nTurkey red again! I surrendered.\n\"All right,\" I said, \"give me Turkey red.\"\n\"How much, sir?\" she asked.\n\"I don't know -- say fifteen meters.\"\nShe looked at me strangely, but measured off fifteen meters of Turkey red calico. Then she touched the counter and called out, \"Cash!\"\nA young girl with yellow hair appeared. The woman wrote the number of meters, the name of the goods, her own number, the price, and the amount of money I gave her, on a piece of paper. She probably wrote some other things, like the color of my eyes and the direction and speed of the wind.\nShe then copied all this into a little book. Then she gave the piece of paper, the money, and the Turkey red cloth to the yellow-haired girl. This girl copied the information into a little book she carried. Then she went away with the calico, the paper and the money.\nAfter a very long time, the girl came back, bringing the money I was owed and the package of Turkey red calico. I returned to my office, but had time for very little work the rest of the day. When I reached home I gave the package of calico to my wife. She opened it and declared, \"Why, this doesn’t match the piece I gave you!\"\n\"Match it!\" I cried. \"Oh, no! It doesn’t match it. You didn't want that matched. You were mistaken. What you wanted was Turkey red — third counter to the left. I mean, Turkey red is what they use.\"\nMy wife looked at me in surprise, and then I told her my troubles.\n\"Well,\" said she, \"this Turkey red is much nicer looking than what I had. You've got so much of it that I don’t have to use the other at all. I wish I had thought of Turkey red before.\"\n\"I wish from the bottom of my heart you had,\" said I.",

		"title"		: "The Californian's Tale\nby Mark Twain",
		"text"		: "Our story today is called “The Californian’s Tale.\" It was written by Mark Twain. Here is Shep O’Neal with the story.\nWhen I was young, I went looking for gold in California. I never found enough to make me rich. But I did discover a beautiful part of the country. It was called “the Stanislau.” The Stanislau was like Heaven on Earth. It had bright green hills and deep forests where soft winds touched the trees.\nOther men, also looking for gold, had reached the Stanislau hills of California many years before I did. They had built a town in the valley with sidewalks and stores, banks and schools. They had also built pretty little houses for their families.\nAt first, they found a lot of gold in the Stanislau hills. But their good luck did not last. After a few years, the gold disappeared. By the time I reached the Stanislau, all the people were gone, too.\nGrass now grew in the streets. And the little houses were covered by wild rose bushes. Only the sound of insects filled the air as I walked through the empty town that summer day so long ago. Then, I realized I was not alone after all.\nA man was smiling at me as he stood in front of one of the little houses. This house was not covered by wild rose bushes. A nice little garden in front of the house was full of blue and yellow flowers. White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind.\nStill smiling, the man opened the door of his house and motioned to me. I went inside and could not believe my eyes. I had been living for weeks in rough mining camps with other gold miners. We slept on the hard ground, ate canned beans from cold metal plates and spent our days in the difficult search for gold.\nHere in this little house, my spirit seemed to come to life again.\nI saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor. Pictures hung all around the room. And on little tables there were seashells, books and china vases full of flowers. A woman had made this house into a home.\nThe pleasure I felt in my heart must have shown on my face. The man read my thoughts. “Yes,” he smiled, “it is all her work. Everything in this room has felt the touch of her hand.”\nOne of the pictures on the wall was not hanging straight. He noticed it and went to fix it. He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was really straight. Then he gave it a gentle touch with his hand.\n“She always does that,” he explained to me. “It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child’s hair after she has brushed it. I have seen her fix all these things so often that I can do it just the way she does. I don’t know why I do it. I just do it.”\nAs he talked, I realized there was something in this room that he wanted me to discover. I looked around. When my eyes reached a corner of the room near the fireplace, he broke into a happy laugh and rubbed his hands together.\n“That’s it!” he cried out. “You have found it! I knew you would. It is her picture. I went to a little black shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. There was a sweetness and softness in the woman’s expression that I had never seen before.\nThe man took the picture from my hands and stared at it. “She was nineteen on her last birthday. That was the day we were married. When you see her…oh, just wait until you meet her!”\n“Where is she now?” I asked.\n“Oh, she is away,” the man sighed, putting the picture back on the little black shelf. “She went to visit her parents. They live forty or fifty miles from here. She has been gone two weeks today.”\n“When will she be back?” I asked. “Well, this is Wednesday,” he said slowly. “She will be back on Saturday, in the evening.”\nI felt a sharp sense of regret. “I am sorry, because I will be gone by then,” I said.\n“Gone? No! Why should you go? Don’t go. She will be so sorry. You see, she likes to have people come and stay with us.”\n“No, I really must leave,” I said firmly.\nHe picked up her picture and held it before my eyes. “Here,” he said. “Now you tell her to her face that you could have stayed to meet her and you would not.”\nSomething made me change my mind as I looked at the picture for a second time. I decided to stay.\nThe man told me his name was Henry.\nThat night, Henry and I talked about many different things, but mainly about her. The next day passed quietly.\nThursday evening we had a visitor. He was a big, grey-haired miner named Tom. “I just came for a few minutes to ask when she is coming home,” he explained. “Is there any news?”\n“Oh yes,” the man replied. “I got a letter. Would you like to hear it? He took a yellowed letter out of his shirt pocket and read it to us. It was full of loving messages to him and to other people – their close friends and neighbors. When the man finished reading it, he looked at his friend. “Oh no, you are doing it again, Tom! You always cry when I read a letter from her. I’m going to tell her this time!”\n“No, you must not do that, Henry,” the grey-haired miner said. “I am getting old. And any little sorrow makes me cry. I really was hoping she would be here tonight.”\nThe next day, Friday, another old miner came to visit. He asked to hear the letter. The message in it made him cry, too. “We all miss her so much,” he said.\nSaturday finally came. I found I was looking at my watch very often. Henry noticed this. “You don’t think something has happened to her, do you?” he asked me.\nI smiled and said that I was sure she was just fine. But he did not seem satisfied.\nI was glad to see his two friends, Tom and Joe, coming down the road as the sun began to set. The old miners were carrying guitars. They also brought flowers and a bottle of whiskey. They put the flowers in vases and began to play some fast and lively songs on their guitars.\nHenry’s friends kept giving him glasses of whiskey, which they made him drink. When I reached for one of the two glasses left on the table, Tom stopped my arm. “Drop that glass and take the other one!” he whispered. He gave the remaining glass of whiskey to Henry just as the clock began to strike midnight.\nHenry emptied the glass. His face grew whiter and whiter. “Boys,” he said, “I am feeling sick. I want to lie down.”\nHenry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth.\nIn a moment, his two friends had picked him up and carried him into the bedroom. They closed the door and came back. They seemed to be getting ready to leave. So I said, “Please don’t go gentlemen. She will not know me. I am a stranger to her.”\nThey looked at each other. “His wife has been dead for nineteen years,” Tom said.\n“Dead?” I whispered.\n“Dead or worse,” he said.\n“She went to see her parents about six months after she got married. On her way back, on a Saturday evening in June, when she was almost here, the Indians captured her. No one ever saw her again. Henry lost his mind. He thinks she is still alive. When June comes, he thinks she has gone on her trip to see her parents. Then he begins to wait for her to come back. He gets out that old letter. And we come around to visit so he can read it to us.\n“On the Saturday night she is supposed to come home, we come here to be with him. We put a sleeping drug in his drink so he will sleep through the night. Then he is all right for another year.”\nJoe picked up his hat and his guitar. “We have done this every June for nineteen years,” he said. “The first year there were twenty-seven of us. Now just the two of us are left.” He opened the door of the pretty little house. And the two old men disappeared into the darkness of the Stanislau.",

		"title"		: "Doctor Heidegger’s Experiment\nby Nathaniel Hawthorne",
		"text"		: "Today, We present the short story \"Doctor Heidegger's Experiment\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Here is Barbara Klein with the story.\nThat very unusual man, old Doctor Heidegger, once invited four friends to meet him in his office. There were three white-bearded gentlemen, Mister Medbourne, Colonel Killigrew, and Mister Gascoigne. And, there was a thin old lady whose husband had died, so she was called the Widow Wycherly.\nThey were all sad old creatures who had been unfortunate in life. As a young man, Mister Medbourne had lost all his money in a badly planned business deal. Colonel Killigrew had wasted his best years and health enjoying the pleasures of women and drink. Mister Gascoigne was a ruined politician with an evil past.\nAs for the Widow Wycherly, tradition tells us that she was once a great beauty. But shocking stories about her past had led the people of the town to reject her. So, she lived very much alone.\nIt is worth stating that each of these three men were early lovers of the Widow Wycherly. And they had once been on the point of killing each other over her.\n\"My dear old friends,\" said Doctor Heidegger, \"I would like your help in one of my little experiments.\" He motioned for them to sit down.\nDoctor Heidegger's office was a very strange place. The dark room was filled with books, cobwebs, and dust. An old mirror hanging between two bookcases was said to show the ghosts of all the doctor's dead patients.\nOn another wall hung a painting of the young woman Doctor Heidegger was to have married long ago. But she died the night before their wedding after drinking one of the doctor's medicines. The most mysterious object in the room was a large book covered in black leather. It was said to be a book of magic.\nOn the summer afternoon of our story, a black table stood in the middle of the room. On it was a beautiful cut-glass vase. Four glasses were also on the table.\nDoctor Heidegger was known for his unusual experiments. But his four guests did not expect anything very interesting.\nThe doctor picked up his black leather book of magic. From its pages he removed a dried-up old rose.\n\"This rose,\" said the doctor, \"was given to me fifty-five years ago by Sylvia Ward, whose painting hangs on this wall. I was to wear it at our wedding. Would you think it possible that this ancient rose could ever bloom again?\"\n\"Nonsense!\" said the Widow Wycherly with a toss of her head. \"You might as well ask if an old woman's lined face could ever bloom again.\"\n\"See!\" answered Doctor Heidegger.\nHe reached for the vase and threw the dried rose into the water it contained. Soon, a change began to appear. The crushed and dried petals moved and slowly turned from brown to red. And there was the rose of half a century looking as fresh as when Sylvia Ward had first given it to her lover.\n\"That is a very pretty trick,\" said the doctor's friends. \"What is the secret?\"\n\"Did you ever hear of the Fountain of Youth?\" asked Doctor Heidegger. \"The Spanish explorer Ponce De Leon went in search of it centuries ago. But he was not looking in the right place. If I am rightly informed, the famous Fountain of Youth is in southern Florida. A friend of mine has sent me the water you see in the vase.\"\nThe doctor filled the four glasses with water from the Fountain of Youth. The liquid produced little bubbles that rose up to the silvery surface. The old guests agreed to drink the water, although they did not believe in its power.\n\"Before you drink, my friends,\" the doctor said, \"you should draw up a few general rules as guidance before you pass a second time through the dangers of youth. You have had a lifetime of experience to direct you. Think what a shame it would be if the wisdom of your experiences did not act as a guide and teacher.\"\nThe doctor's four friends answered him with a laugh. The idea that they would ever repeat the mistakes of their youth was very funny.\n\"Drink, then,\" said the doctor. \"I am happy that I have so well chosen the subjects of my experiment.\"\nThey raised the glasses to their lips. If the liquid really was magical, it could not have been given to four human beings who needed it more. They seemed as though they had never known youth or pleasure. They looked like they had always been the weak, unhappy creatures who were bent over the doctor's table.\nThey drank the water.\nThere was an almost immediate improvement among the guests. A cheerful glow like sunshine brightened their faces. They looked at one another imagining that some magic power had really started to smooth the lines on their faces.\n\"Quick! Give us more of this wondrous water!\" they cried. \"We are younger, but we are still too old!\"\n\"Patience!\" said Doctor Heidegger who watched the experiment with scientific coolness. \"You have been a long time growing old. Surely you could wait half an hour to grow young!\"\nAgain he filled their glasses. The four guests drank the liquid in one swallow. As the liquid passed down their throats it seemed to change their whole systems. Their eyes grew clear and bright. Their hair turned from silver to darker shades.\n\"My dear widow, you are lovely!\" cried Colonel Killigrew, who watched as the signs of age disappeared from her face.\nThe widow ran to the mirror.\nThe three men started to behave in such a way that proved the magic of the Fountain of Youth's water.\nMister Gascoigne's mind turned to political topics. He talked about nationalism and the rights of the people. He also told secrets softly to himself.\nAll this time Colonel Killigrew had been shouting out happy drinking songs while his eyes turned towards the curvy body of the Widow Wycherly.\nMister Medbourne was adding dollars and cents to pay for a proposed project. It would supply the East Indies with ice by linking a team of whales to the polar icebergs.\nAs for the Widow Wycherly, she stood in front of the mirror greeting her image as a friend she loved better than anything in the world.\n\"My dear old doctor,\" she cried, \"please give me another glass!\"\nThe doctor had already filled the glasses again. It was now near sunset and the room was darker than ever. But a moon-like light shined from within the vase. The doctor sat in his chair watching. As the four guests drank their third glass of water, they were silenced by the expression on the doctor's mysterious face.\nThe next moment, the exciting rush of young life shot through their blood. They were now at the happy height of youth. The endless cares, sadness, and diseases of age were remembered only as a troubled dream from which they had awoken.\n\"We are young!\" they cried.\nThe guests were a group of happy youngsters almost crazy with energy. They laughed at the old-fashioned clothing they wore. They shouted happily and jumped around the room.\nThe Widow Wycherly - if such a young lady could be called a widow - ran to the doctor's chair and asked him to dance.\n\"Please excuse me,\" answered the doctor quietly. \"My dancing days were over long ago. But these three young men would be happy to have such a lovely partner.\"\nThe men began to argue violently about who would dance with her. They gathered around the widow, each grabbing for her.\nYet, by a strange trick owing to the darkness of the room, the tall mirror is said to have reflected the forms of three old, gray men competing for a faded, old woman.\nAs the three fought for the woman's favor, they reached violently for each other's throats. In their struggle, they turned over the table. The vase broke into a thousand pieces. The Water of Youth flowed in a bright stream across the floor.\nThe guests stood still. A strange coldness was slowly stealing over them all. They looked at Doctor Heidegger who was holding his treasured rose. The flower was fading and drying up once more.\nThe guests looked at each other and saw their looks changing back. \"Are we grown old again so soon?\" they cried.\nIn truth they had. The Water of Youth had powers that were only temporary.\n\"Yes, friends, you are old again,\" the doctor said. \"And the Water of Youth lies wasted on the ground. But even if it flowed in a river at my door, I still would not drink it. This is the lesson you have taught me!\"\nBut the doctor's four friends had learned no such lesson.

		"title"		: "The Ambitious Guest\nby Nathaniel Hawthorne",
		"text"		: "Our story today is called \"The Ambitious Guest. \" It was written by Nathaniel Hawthorne. Here is Harry Monroe with our story.\nOne December night, a long, long time ago, a family sat around the fireplace in their home. A golden light from the fire filled the room. The mother and father laughed at something their oldest daughter had just said. The girl was seventeen, much older than her little brother and sister, who were only five and six years old.\nA very old woman, the family's grandmother, sat knitting in the warmest corner of the room. And a baby, the youngest child, smiled at the fire's light from its tiny bed. This family had found happiness in the worst place in all of New England. They had built their home high up in the White Mountains, where the wind blows violently all year long.\nThe family lived in an especially cold and dangerous spot. Stones from the top of the mountain above their house would often roll down the mountainside and wake them in the middle of the night. No other family lived near them on the mountain. But this family was never lonely. They enjoyed each other's company, and often had visitors. Their house was built near an important road that connected the White Mountains to the Saint Lawrence River.\nPeople traveling through the mountains in wagons always stopped at the family's door for a drink of water and a friendly word. Lonely travelers, crossing the mountains on foot, would step into the house to share a hot meal. Sometimes, the wind became so wild and cold that these strangers would spend the night with the family. The family offered every traveler who stopped at their home a kindness that money could not buy.\nOn that December evening, the wind came rushing down the mountain. It seemed to stop at their house to knock at the door before it roared down into the valley. The family fell silent for a moment. But then they realized that someone really was knocking at their door. The oldest girl opened the door and found a young man standing in the dark.\nThe old grandmother put a chair near the fireplace for him. The oldest daughter gave him a warm, shy smile. And the baby held up its little arms to him. \"This fire is just what I needed,\" the young man said. \"The wind has been blowing in my face for the last two hours.\"\nThe father took the young man's travel bag. \"Are you going to Vermont?\" the older man asked. \"Yes, to Burlington,\" the traveler replied. \"I wanted to reach the valley tonight. But when I saw the light in your window, I decided to stop. I would like to sit and enjoy your fire and your company for a while.\"\nAs the young man took his place by the fire, something like heavy footsteps was heard outside. It sounded as if someone was running down the side of the mountain, taking enormous steps. The father looked out one of the windows.\n\"That old mountain has thrown another stone at us again. He must have been afraid we would forget him. He sometimes shakes his head and makes us think he will come down on top of us,\" the father explained to the young man. \"But we are old neighbors,\" he smiled. \"And we manage to get along together pretty well. Besides, I have made a safe hiding place outside to protect us in case a slide brings the mountain down on our heads.\"\nAs the father spoke, the mother prepared a hot meal for their guest. While he ate, he talked freely to the family, as if it were his own. This young man did not trust people easily. Yet on this evening, something made him share his deepest secret with these simple mountain people.\nThe young man's secret was that he was ambitious. He did not know what he wanted to do with his life, yet. But he did know that he did not want to be forgotten after he had died. He believed that sometime during his life, he would become famous and be admired by thousands of people. \"So far,\" the young man said, \"I have done nothing. If I disappeared tomorrow from the face of the earth, no one would know anything about me. No one would ask 'Who was he. Where did he go?' But I cannot die until I have reached my destiny. Then let death come! I will have built my monument!\"\nThe young man's powerful emotions touched the family. They smiled. \"You laugh at me,\" the young man said, taking the oldest daughter's hand. \"You think my ambition is silly.\" She was very shy, and her face became pink with embarrassment. \"It is better to sit here by the fire,\" she whispered, \"and be happy, even if nobody thinks of us.\"\nHer father stared into the fire. \"I think there is something natural in what the young man says. And his words have made me think about our own lives here. \"It would have been nice if we had had a little farm down in the valley. Some place where we could see our mountains without being afraid they would fall on our heads. I would have been respected by all our neighbors. And, when I had grown old, I would die happy in my bed. You would put a stone over my grave so everyone would know I lived an honest life.\"\n\"You see!\" the young man cried out. \"It is in our nature to want a monument. Some want only a stone on their grave. Others want to be a part of everyone's memory. But we all want to be remembered after we die!\" The young man threw some more wood on the fire to chase away the darkness.\nThe firelight fell on the little group around the fireplace: the father's strong arms and the mother's gentle smile. It touched the young man's proud face, and the daughter's shy one. It warmed the old grandmother, still knitting in the corner. She looked up from her knitting and, with her fingers still moving the needles, she said, \"Old people have their secrets, just as young people do.\"\nThe old woman said she had made her funeral clothes some years earlier. They were the finest clothes she had made since her wedding dress. She said her secret was a fear that she would not be buried in her best clothes. The young man stared into the fire. \"Old and young,\" he said. \"We dream of graves and monuments. I wonder how sailors feel when their ship is sinking, and they know they will be buried in the wide and nameless grave that is the ocean?\"\nA sound, rising like the roar of the ocean, shook the house. Young and old exchanged one wild look. Then the same words burst from all their lips. \"The slide! The slide!\" They rushed away from the house, into the darkness, to the secret spot the father had built to protect them from the mountain slide. The whole side of the mountain came rushing toward the house like a waterfall of destruction.\nBut just before it reached the little house, the wave of earth divided in two and went around the family's home. Everyone and everything in the path of the terrible slide was destroyed, except the little house. The next morning, smoke was seen coming from the chimney of the house on the mountain. Inside, the fire was still burning. The chairs were still drawn up in a half circle around the fireplace. It looked as if the family had just gone out for a walk.\nSome people thought that a stranger had been with the family on that terrible night. But no one ever discovered who the stranger was. His name and way of life remain a mystery. His body was never found.",

		"title"		: "The Masque of the Red Death\nby Edgar Allan Poe",
		"text"		: "The Red Death had long been feeding on the country.\nNo sickness had ever been so deadly — so great a killer — or so fearful to see. Blood was its mark — the redness and the horror of blood.\nThere were sharp pains, and a sudden feeling that the mind was rushing in circles inside the head. Then there was bleeding through the skin, though it was not cut or broken — and then, death!\nThe bright red spots upon the body and especially upon the face of the sick man made other men turn away from him, afraid to try to help. And the sickness lasted, from beginning to the end, no more than half an hour.\nBut Prospero, the ruler of that land, was happy and strong and wise. When half the people of his land had died, he called to him a thousand healthy, happy friends, and with them went far away to live in one of his palaces.\nThis was a large and beautiful stone building he had planned himself. A strong, high wall circled it. This wall had gates of iron. The gentlemen, after they had entered, brought fire to heat the iron of the gate to make them close so firmly that nobody could open them. Here they could forget the sickness, the Red Death. They would leave the outside world to care for itself.\nProspero had supplied everything they needed for pleasure. There was music. There was dancing. There was beauty. There was food to eat and wine to drink. All these were within the wall, and within the wall they would be safe. Outside the wall walked the Red Death.\nIt was near the end of their fifth month there that Prospero asked his friends to all to come together for a dancing party, a masquerade. Everyone was asked to come dressed in fine clothes and with his eyes, or perhaps his whole face, covered by a cloth mask.\nIt was a scene of great richness, that masquerade. There were seven rooms in which Prospero’s friends danced. In many old palaces, the doors can be opened in such a way that rooms like these seven can be seen all at the same time. In this palace, it was different. Little more than one of them could be seen at one time. There was a turn every 20 or 30 yards.\nTo the right and left, in the middle of each wall, was a tall pointed window. The windows were of colored glass, of the same color that was used in each room. The first room had blue cloth hangings on the wall — and blue were its windows. The second room had wall hangings of that blue-red known as purple, and here the windows were purple. The third was green, and so was the glass of the windows. The fourth had hangings and windows of yellow — the fifth of white — the sixth of violet. But the seventh room had hangings on the walls made of a rich, soft cloth which was black, black as night. And the floor, too, was covered with the same heavy black cloth. In this room the color of the windows was not the same. It was red — a deep blood color.\nAll the rooms were lighted through the outside windows. The resulting light was strange indeed, as it colored the shapes of the dancers. But the light that fell on the black hangings through the blood-colored glass was the most fearful of them all. It produced so wild a look on the faces of those who entered that there were few of the dancers who dared to step within those dark walls.\nIn this room stood a great clock of black wood. Gently it marked the seconds as they passed; and when it was time to mark the hour the clock spoke with a loud, clear voice: a deep tone as beautiful as music, but so strange that the music and the dancing stopped and the dancers stood still to listen. And then, after another 60 minutes, after another 3,600 seconds of Time, of flying Time, the clock struck again, and the dancers stopped as before.\nNevertheless, it was a happy and beautiful masquerade. And you may be sure that the clothes the dancers chose to wear, their costumes, were strange and wonderful. The dancers looked like the forms we might see in troubled dreams. And these — the dreams — danced softly through the rooms, taking the color of the rooms as they moved. It did not seem that their steps followed the music, but that the music rose from their steps. But into the seventh room the dancers do not go, for the red light coming through the windows, and the blackness of the wall hangings, make them afraid — and he who enters hears more deeply the striking of the great black clock.\nBut the other rooms are crowded, and in them beats hotly the heart of life. And the dance goes on until at last the clock begins to strike 12. Again the music stopped. Again the dancers stood without moving while the slow striking sound continued. Before the clock was quiet again, many in the crowd saw that in the first room, the blue room, there was a masquerader who had not been seen before. As they talked softly to each other about him, a feeling of surprise spread through all the dancers, then a feeling of fear and sickening horror.\nIn such a group as this, only a very strange masquerader could have caused such a feeling. Even among those who laugh at both life and death, some matters cannot be laughed at. Everyone seemed now deeply to feel that the stranger should not have been allowed to come among them dressed in such clothes.\nHe was tall and very thin, and covered from head to foot like a dead man prepared for the grave. The mask which covered his face — or was it really a mask? — the mask which covered his face was so much like the face of a dead man that the nearest eye could not see the difference. And yet all this might have been acceptable — but the masquerader whom no one knew had made himself look like the Red Death itself! His clothes were spotted with blood. And the mask over his face was covered with the terrible red spots…or perhaps it was indeed his face!\nWhen Prospero looked upon this fearful form, he was first filled with terror — and then with anger. “Who dares?” he cried. “Take him! Seize him! Pull off his mask so that we may know who we must hang at sunrise!”\nProspero stood in the blue room when he spoke these words. They sounded through the 7 rooms, loud and clear. At first, as he spoke, some of the dancers started to rush toward the strange masquerader. But they stopped, afraid, and no one dared to put out a hand to touch him.\nThe stranger started to walk toward the second room. He passed within a few feet of Prospero, who stood still, surprised. And while the dancers moved back from the center of the room, the stranger moved quietly, without being stopped, with a slow, measured step, through the blue room to the purple room — through the purple room to the green room — through the green to the yellow — through this to the white — and then to the violet room.\nAs the stranger was entering the seventh room, Prospero suddenly and angrily rushed through the six rooms. No one dared to follow him. He held a sharp knife high over his head, ready to strike the stranger. When he was within three or four feet, the strange masquerader, the stranger, turned and stood silent, looking firmly into Prospero’s eyes.\nThere was a cry — and the knife dropped shining upon the black floor, upon which a minute later Prospero himself fell, dead. The dancers then rushed into the black room. The strongest of the men tried to hold the masquerader, whose tall form stood beside the black clock. But when they put their hands on him they found inside the grave-clothes no human form, no body — nothing!\nNow they knew that it was the Red Death itself that had come in the night. One by one, the dancers fell, and each died as he fell. And the fires died. And the clock stopped. And darkness and decay and the Red Death ruled forever over all.",

    //     "title"		: "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow",
    //     "text"		: "Today's story is called \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. It is about something strange that happened long ago in a valley called \"Sleepy Hollow\". It was written by Washington Irving. The story is told by Doug Johnson.\nThe valley known as Sleepy Hollow hides from the world in the high hills of New York state. There are many stories told about the quiet valley. But the story that people believe most is about a man who rides a horse at night. The story says the man died many years ago during the American Revolutionary War. His head was shot off. Every night he rises from his burial place, jumps on his horse and rides through the valley looking for his lost head.\nNear Sleepy Hollow is a village called Tarry Town. It was settled many years ago by people from Holland. The village had a small school. And one teacher, named Ichabod Crane. Ichabod Crane was a good name for him, because he looked like a tall bird, a crane. He was tall and thin like a crane. His shoulders were small, joined two long arms. His head was small, too, and flat on top. He had big ears, large glassy green eyes and a long nose.\nIchabod did not make much money as a teacher. And although he was tall and thin, he ate like a fat man. To help him pay for his food he earned extra money teaching young people to sing. Every Sunday after church Ichabod taught singing.\nAmong the ladies Ichabod taught was one Katrina Van Tassel. She was the only daughter of a rich Dutch farmer. She was a girl in bloom…much like a round red, rosy apple. Ichabod had a soft and foolish heart for the ladies, and soon found himself interested in Miss Van Tassel.\nIchabod's eyes opened wide when he saw the riches of Katrina's farm: the miles of apple trees and wheat fields, and hundreds of fat farm animals. He saw himself as master of the Van Tassel farm with Katrina as his wife.\nBut there were many problems blocking the road to Katrina's heart. One was a strong young man named Brom Van Brunt. Brom was a hero to all the young ladies. His shoulders were big. His back was wide. And his hair was short and curly. He always won the horse races in Tarry Town and earned many prizes. Brom was never seen without a horse.\n \nSuch was the enemy Ichabod had to defeat for Katrina's heart.\nStronger and wiser men would not have tried. But Ichabod had a plan. He could not fight his enemy in the open. So he did it silently and secretly. He made many visits to Katrina's farm and made her think he was helping her to sing better.\nTime passed, and the town people thought Ichabod was winning. Brom's horse was never seen at Katrina's house on Sunday nights anymore.\nOne day in autumn Ichabod was asked to come to a big party at the Van Tassel home. He dressed in his best clothes. A farmer loaned him an old horse for the long trip to the party.\nThe house was filled with farmers and their wives, red-faced daughters and clean, washed sons. The tables were filled with different things to eat. Wine filled many glasses.\nBrom Van Brunt rode to the party on his fastest horse called Daredevil. All the young ladies smiled happily when they saw him. Soon music filled the rooms and everyone began to dance and sing.\nIchabod was happy dancing with Katrina as Brom looked at them with a jealous heart. The night passed. The music stopped, and the young people sat together to tell stories about the revolutionary war.\nSoon stories about Sleepy Hollow were told. The most feared story was about the rider looking for his lost head. One farmer told how he raced the headless man on a horse. The farmer ran his horse faster and faster. The horseman followed over bush and stone until they came to the end of the valley. There the headless horseman suddenly stopped. Gone were his clothes and his skin. All that was left was a man with white bones shining in the moonlight.\nThe stories ended and time came to leave the party. Ichabod seemed very happy until he said goodnight to Katrina. Was she ending their romance? He left feeling very sad. Had Katrina been seeing Ichabod just to make Brom Van Brunt jealous so he would marry her?\nWell, Ichabod began his long ride home on the hills that surround Tarry Town. He had never felt so lonely in his life. He began to whistle as he came close to the tree where a man had been killed years ago by rebels.\nHe thought he saw something white move in the tree. But no, it was only the moonlight shining and moving on the tree. Then he heard a noise. His body shook. He kicked his horse faster. The old horse tried to run, but almost fell in the river, instead. Ichabod hit the horse again. The horse ran fast and then suddenly stopped, almost throwing Ichabod forward to the ground.\nThere, in the dark woods on the side of the river where the bushes grow low, stood an ugly thing. Big and black. It did not move, but seemed ready to jump like a giant monster.\nIchabod's hair stood straight up. It was too late to run, and in his fear, he did the only thing he could. His shaking voice broke the silent valley.\n\"Who are you?\" The thing did not answer. Ichabod asked again. Still no answer. Ichabod's old horse began to move forward. The black thing began to move along the side of Ichabod's horse in the dark. Ichabod made his horse run faster. The black thing moved with them. Side by side they moved, slowly at first. And not a word was said.\nIchabod felt his heart sink. Up a hill they moved above the shadow of the trees. For a moment the moon shown down and to Ichabod's horror he saw it was a horse. And it had a rider. But the rider's head was not on his body. It was in front of the rider, resting on the horse.\nIchabod kicked and hit his old horse with all his power. Away they rushed through bushes and trees across the valley of Sleepy Hollow. Up ahead was the old church bridge where the headless horseman stops and returns to his burial place.\n\"If only I can get there first, I am safe,\" thought Ichabod. He kicked his horse again. The horse jumped on to the bridge and raced over it like the sound of thunder. Ichabod looked back to see if the headless man had stopped. He saw the man pick up his head and throw it with a powerful force. The head hit Ichabod in the face and knocked him off his horse to the dirt below.\nThey found Ichabod's horse the next day peacefully eating grass. They could not find Ichabod.\nThey walked all across the valley. They saw the foot marks of Ichabod's horse as it had raced through the valley. They even found Ichabod's old hat in the dust near the bridge. But they did not find Ichabod. The only other thing they found was lying near Ichabod's hat.\nIt was the broken pieces of a round orange pumpkin.\nThe town people talked about Ichabod for many weeks. They remembered the frightening stories of the valley. And finally they came to believe that the headless horseman had carried Ichabod away.\nMuch later an old farmer returned from a visit to New York City. He said he was sure he saw Ichabod there. He thought Ichabod silently left Sleepy Hollow because he had lost Katrina.\nAs for Katrina, her mother and father gave her a big wedding when she married Brom Van Brunt. Many people who went to the wedding saw that Brom smiled whenever Ichabod's name was spoken. And they wondered why he laughed out loud when anyone talked about the broken orange pumpkin found lying near Ichabod's old dusty hat.",
