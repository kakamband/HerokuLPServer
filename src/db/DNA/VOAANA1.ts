Let’s learn how to play baseball! This is a baseball field. This is a pitcher's mound. This is first base! This is second base! This is third base! This is home plate!\nAnna: To play baseball, you really only need a bat, a ball and a glove. Each team has many players.\nPitchers pitch the ball.\nCatchers catch the ball.\nBatters bat the ball.\nRunners run the bases.\nFielders field the ball.\nAnna: First, the pitcher pitches the ball to the batter. The batter bats the ball. Then, the runner runs to first base. \nAnna: Each time a batter bats, the runners run around the bases. Each time a runner runs across home plate, they score a run! There are nine innings in a game. The team with the most runs at the end of nine innings wins the game!\nAnna: MINDY, MINDY, we found the answer!

		text		: "Anna: Hello, and welcome to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.! I am going back to school! Georgetown is the oldest Catholic and Jesuit university in the United States. The Jesuits are a religious order known worldwide for their many colleges and universities. Students have been studying here since 1792!\nSarah: Hey, are you finished with your report?\nTaylor: Almost. I have been writing and re-writing since last night! The subject is really interesting to me.\nSarah: Me too! I have been studying this topic* for a long time.\nAnna: Am I late?\nSarah: You’re a little late. But don’t worry. The professor isn’t here yet.\nAnna: How long has the class been waiting?\nTaylor: We’ve only been waiting for about 10 minutes.\nAnna: Oh good. Oh, no! I forgot my pencil sharpener. Excuse me, do you have a pencil sharpener I can borrow?\nTaylor: No, sorry.\nAnna: Oh wait. I found my extra one! Whew, that was close.\nAnna: So, how long have you been studying at Georgetown?\nAndrew: I’ve been studying here since 2015.\nAnna: Awesome. You know, I've been wanting to go back to school for a long time. So, here I am!\nAndrew: Well, you picked a great school. I’ve been really happy here.\nAnna: Awesome. See, I’ve been working for several years now. So, going back to school makes me a little nervous.\nRandall: Don’t be nervous. Just pay attention and do your best!\nAnna: That is great advice. You know, I have been paying attention. But sometimes I still feel like I don’t understand. Like last week …\nAnna: What’s that?\nJada: This is my draft.\nAnna: What draft?\nJada: The professor told us to bring our drafts.\nAnna: I think she said “giraffe.”\nJada: No. She didn’t.\nAnna: Here comes the professor.\nDr. Jones: Hello class! Sorry I'm late, but the snow storm made getting here really difficult. I see you’ve been waiting very patiently. So, let’s get started! Who wants to give their talk first?\nAnna: Oh! Oh! Please, please pick me.\nDr. Jones: Anna?\nAnna: Who me? Sure. Thanks.\nAnna: Here is my report on “Violins in the City.”\nAnna: People have been looking for a solution to the problem of violins in the city. I say stop! Stop! They are not the problem! In fact, violins are part of the solution!\nAnna: Violins create beautiful music that can fill a city with hope.\nDr. Jones: Anna …\nAnna: If we put a violin in the hands of every child …\nDr. Jones: Anna! The topic is “Violence in the city.” Violence. Not violins.\nAnna: Until next time …Like I was saying, many people are saying that violence in the city is a problem. A very big problem.\n\n* topic = subject\nThanks to Georgetown University for allowing us to film on their historic campus. And a special thanks to the Georgetown students and staff who appeared in this episode: Andrew Debraggio, Sarah Mucha, Taylor Soergel, Jada Bullen, and Randall-Grace Johnson.",

		text		: "Anna: D.C. is a popular city for marathons! A marathon is a long race. Many marathons raise money for charity, you know - good works. A marathon is a good fitness goal too. I want to challenge myself in a marathon and maybe win a medal! Hey, there’s Ashley. Ashley! Wait for me! It’s Anna!\nAnna: Ash … ley. Ash … ley.\nAshley: Are you okay, Anna?\nAnna: I just ran … from over there.\nAshley: Do you want to sit down, Anna? Do you want some water? (Anna takes the bottle and tries to return it.) No thanks. You keep it.\nAnna: Thanks. I didn’t know you like to run.\nAshley: I love running. In fact, this weekend, I will run in my first marathon.\nAnna: Me … too.\nAshley: Really? You are running in a marathon?\nAnna: Yeah. In a couple of days. Why do you ask … like that?\nAshley: What do you know about running in a marathon?\nAnna: I know that there’s a lot of running and sometimes you can win a medal. \nAshley: How long have you been training?\nAnna: I started today. I’ve been training for an hour … no, an hour and seven minutes!\nAshley: Anna, training a little every day is a good habit to get into. Not all at once!\nAnna: Thanks for the advice, Ashley. But I’m running in a special race.\nAshley: What marathon is it?\nAnna: I don’t remember the name. But the website said everyone gets a medal.\nAshley: Okay, well, good luck, Anna!\nAnna: Thanks, Ashley. Good luck to you, too.\nAshley: Thank you.\nAnna: Bye!\nAshley: Bye, Anna!\nAnna: See you!\n(At the race: an announcer calls out race information)\nAnna: Hello. I am here to enter the race!\nWoman: But ma’am you can’t enter the race.\nAnna: What? How am I going to meet my goal?\nWoman: Ma’am, this race is for children. You can’t run with the children.\nAnna: Children? Children. That’s perfect. I just might win!\nWoman: No, ma’am. You really can’t run with the children.\nAnna: I’m sorry. Of course. I was only thinking of my goal.\nWoman: Well, you can help us with our goal, which is to raise money for sick children. Would you like to help us?\nAnna: I’ve just found my new goal. And I get to wear a medal. (to child who finished race) Good job!",

		text		: "Anna: Hello, it's Anna! I did it - Washington, D.C. is my home. Looking back over the past year, I’ve done so many amazing things! I have met people from all over the world. I’ve made many good friends. And I have a great job! And I've taken a lot of chances. And now I have some really big news! Wait for it… and 3, 2, 1…\nKelly: Hello and welcome to “Around the Corner and Across the Street from the Actor’s Studio!” Many people dream of becoming actors. But very often, those dreams don’t come true.\nKelly: Well, today we will meet a woman and -- her acting career has really taken off. In fact, she acted in my play, “The Woods Are Alive!” Oh. She really brought the part of Tree Number 15 to life! Let’s give a warm welcome to Anna Matteo!\nAnna: Thank you. Thank you so much for having me here.\nKelly: Please, please, sit down. Here, here, let me help you.\nAnna: Thanks. Thanks. Wow, it is great to see you again, Director Kelly!\nKelly: It’s great to see you too, Anna. I see you are still wearing your tree costume. Does this have anything to do with your big news?\nAnna: Yes. Yes, it does.\nKelly: Well, Anna, please share that news with us.\nAnna: Kelly, I will be acting in three movies.\nKelly: That is amazing! Anna, tell us more.\nAnna: Well, the first is a science fiction movie. The second is a romantic comedy. And the third is an action movie.\nKelly: That is so great! Let me guess -- you’re playing a tree in all of them!\nAnna: Yes! This is what happened. To prepare for your play, I had to find out what it was like to BE a tree in the world. I had to find out where to eat, where to shop, where to meet people and how to get around the city.\nKelly: Amazing. I think big things are going to happen for you, Anna. So, tell me, will you be moving to Hollywood for a career in movies?\nAnna: No. I’ll make the movies and then come back. Washington, D.C. is my home.\nKelly: I’m sure your family is very proud.\nAnna: Yes, they are. You know, Kelly, not too long ago, I didn’t feel very good about my life. I had to make a change. So, I took some chances. Sometimes I succeeded. Sometimes I failed. But I will never stop trying.\nKelly: Well, thank you for sharing your news and so much more with us, Anna.\nKelly: Until next time …",
