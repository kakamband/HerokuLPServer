When I first came here, I felt lost ... all the time.\nPhil: So, do you like living in the country or in the city?\nAnna: I like to live in the city.\nPhil: Why?\nAnna: The city is exciting! It has more culture than the country. There are many museums and restaurants. Every night, there is theater and music. And, there are more jobs. That is why I'm here.\nPhil: Well, I agree. There is more culture in the city and there might be more jobs. But the country has more nature! It's peaceful and beautiful. There are more trees and mountains. The air is clean. You can go hiking and camping. The city is not beautiful. It's noisy and dirty.\nAnna: I disagree. I think all the different buildings are beautiful. And I like to watch all the different people.\nPhil: That's another thing that is different. People in the country are friendly. They always say \"hello!\" Here, no one says \"hello.\" I think city people are rude.\nAnna: Well, I agree. Country people are friendly. But I don't think city people are rude. I think they're just busy.\nPhil: That's a good point.\nAnna: Look at me. I live in the city and I said \"hello\" to you.\nPhil: But you are from the country.\nAnna: I have an idea. Let's say \"hello!\" to people -- to many people!\nPhil: What? Why?\nAnna: Well, if we say \"hello,\" maybe they will say \"hello\" to other people ... Hello!\nPhil: ... and they will say \"hello\" to more people! That's a great idea! I'm glad you found my bag.\nAnna: Come on. Let's go say \"hello\" to people.\nAnna: We don't have to agree with people. They have their opinions. We have ours. And as we like to say, you can always agree to disagree! Until next time...!

I want to see New York City and the Statue of Liberty!\nMarsha: And I want to see Mount Rushmore!\nAnna: (Anna writes) Mount Rushmore.\nMarsha: And don’t forget the Grand Canyon!\nAnna: (Anna writes) Let’s not forget California’s redwood forest! There are so many places to see!\nMarsha: We will be driving for a long time. So, we might get bored.\nAnna: Bored? No way! We can talk.\nMarsha: Or not talk.\nAnna: We can play word games. We can sing! You know, our trip is like that famous American song. (sings) \"This land is your land, This land is my land …\"*\nMarsha: (sings) \"…from California to the New York island ...\"\nBOTH: “... to the redwood forest to the Gulf stream waters ... this land was made for you and me!”\nMarsha: Will we be stopping soon?\nAnna: We won’t be stopping soon.\nMarsha: I’m hungry.\nAnna: Marsha, we just left D.C.!

We littered! And my list is gone. Don't worry. I brought the book. (lifts up large book, starts reading)\n(Later)\nAnna: … and that is why I am so afraid of sheep.\nMarsha: (snores a little)\nAnna: Wow, I feel better. Marsha, you are a great listener.\nMarsha: (waking up) Where are we?\nAnna: We will be entering North Dakota any minute now!\nMarsha: North Dakota! We are going in the wrong direction! We want to go to South Dakota!\nAnna: No problem. I will just exit the highway. We will be going south … in just a minute. There. Done! We're going south! Okay, we will be stopping for gas and a bathroom break in about an hour.\nMarsha: Then we will be very near to Mount Rushmore!\nAnna: Yay! Dead presidents’ heads on the side of a mountain!\nAnna: We did it, Marsha! We made it to California! It’s beautiful!\nMarsha: And we saw everything on the list!\nAnna: Well, we saw everything on page 1 of the list.\nMarsha: What do you mean \"page 1?\"\nAnna: Oh. Here are pages 2, 3 and 4! We’ll be very busy driving back to Washington, D.C. Until next time … !\n* This Land is Your Land was written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie.

The professor isn’t here yet.\nAnna: How long has the class been waiting?\nTaylor: We’ve only been waiting for about 10 minutes.\nAnna: Oh good. Oh, no! I forgot my pencil sharpener. Excuse me, do you have a pencil sharpener I can borrow?\nTaylor: No, sorry.\nAnna: Oh wait. I found my extra one! Whew, that was close.\nAnna: So, how long have you been studying at Georgetown?\nAndrew: I’ve been studying here since 2015.\nAnna: Awesome. You know, I've been wanting to go back to school for a long time. So, here I am!\nAndrew: Well, you picked a great school. I’ve been really happy here.\nAnna: Awesome. See, I’ve been working for several years now. So, going back to school makes me a little nervous.\nRandall: Don’t be nervous. Just pay attention and do your best!\nAnna: That is great advice.

Sorry I'm late, but the snow storm made getting here really difficult. I see you’ve been waiting very patiently. So, let’s get started! Who wants to give their talk first?\nAnna: Oh! Oh! Please, please pick me.\nDr. Jones: Anna?\nAnna: Who me? Sure. Thanks.\nAnna: Here is my report on “Violins in the City.”\nAnna: People have been looking for a solution to the problem of violins in the city. I say stop! Stop! They are not the problem! In fact, violins are part of the solution!\nAnna: Violins create beautiful music that can fill a city with hope.\nDr. Jones: Anna …\nAnna: If we put a violin in the hands of every child …\nDr. Jones: Anna! The topic is “Violence in the city.” Violence. Not violins.\nAnna: Until next time …Like I was saying, many people are saying that violence in the city is a problem. A very big problem.\n\n* topic = subject\nThanks to Georgetown University for allowing us to film on their historic campus.

I had to find out where to eat, where to shop, where to meet people and how to get around the city.\nKelly: Amazing. I think big things are going to happen for you, Anna. So, tell me, will you be moving to Hollywood for a career in movies?\nAnna: No. I’ll make the movies and then come back.
