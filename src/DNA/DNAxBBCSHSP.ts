		"text"		: "Narrator: It was a chilly November evening. William Shakespeare's play The Tempest, full of music, magic and monsters, is being performed for the first time. King James I and the Queen are having dinner while they watch.: \nKing James: I do like a good play… mmm… and this meat is delicious - bring me more of that pickle… Mmmm… I love a bit of pickle with my dinner… and a nice glass of wine…: \nQueen: Don't you think you've had enough wine, dear?: \nKing James: Oh do be quiet dear: I can't hear the actors. Now, Mr Shakespeare, is that a King I see on the stage?: \nWill: Your Majesty, that is King Alonso of Naples. He is lost on a magical island.: \nKing James: And who is this fellow in the jester's costume?: \nWill: Your Majesty, that is Trinculo. He drinks a lot, and plans to murder people.: \nKing James: A drunken jester? Murder? No good will come of it… does the King know about this?: \nWill: Yes, your Majesty. Now, the King is going to find Trinculo - in a drunken mess. Your Majesty might care to listen…: \nKing James 1: Ooh yes, yes, I want to hear this, be quiet everybody.: \nAlonso: How camest thou in this pickle?: \nRobert Harley as Trinculo: I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.: \nKing James 1: Hahaha! He's in a pickle! I like it, Will, very good, very good!: \nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. Pickles are a very messy food, made from fruit and vegetables, crushed and preserved in vinegar and spices - sometimes with alcohol too. When Trinculo says he is in a pickle, he's probably saying that he is very drunk - but he's also got himself into a mess - a very difficult situation. Nowadays, when someone has drunk a lot of alcohol, they can say: I'm pickled - and when they've got problems, they can say: I'm in a pickle. Take The Hunger Games actor Liam Hemsworth, who said:: \nClip 1: Most of the time if I'm in a pickle I'll call one of my brothers. They've usually got somewhat uplifting advice.: \nClip 2: Ooh, you're in a pickle with those bags aren't you? Let me help.: \nKing James I: Now Mr Shakespeare, sit down and eat with us. Have some cold meat!: \nServant: Anything with that?: \nWill: Hmmm… To pickle, or not to pickle: that is the question.",
