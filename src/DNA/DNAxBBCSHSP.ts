		"title"		: "In a pickle",
		"text"		: "Narrator: It was a chilly November evening. William Shakespeare's play The Tempest, full of music, magic and monsters, is being performed for the first time. King James I and the Queen are having dinner while they watch.\nKing James: I do like a good play… mmm… and this meat is delicious - bring me more of that pickle… Mmmm… I love a bit of pickle with my dinner… and a nice glass of wine…\nQueen: Don't you think you've had enough wine, dear?\nKing James: Oh do be quiet dear: I can't hear the actors. Now, Mr Shakespeare, is that a King I see on the stage?\nWill: Your Majesty, that is King Alonso of Naples. He is lost on a magical island.\nKing James: And who is this fellow in the jester's costume?\nWill: Your Majesty, that is Trinculo. He drinks a lot, and plans to murder people.\nKing James: A drunken jester? Murder? No good will come of it… does the King know about this?\nWill: Yes, your Majesty. Now, the King is going to find Trinculo - in a drunken mess. Your Majesty might care to listen…\nKing James 1: Ooh yes, yes, I want to hear this, be quiet everybody.\nAlonso: How camest thou in this pickle?\nRobert Harley as Trinculo: I have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.\nKing James 1: Hahaha! He's in a pickle! I like it, Will, very good, very good!\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. Pickles are a very messy food, made from fruit and vegetables, crushed and preserved in vinegar and spices - sometimes with alcohol too. When Trinculo says he is in a pickle, he's probably saying that he is very drunk - but he's also got himself into a mess - a very difficult situation. Nowadays, when someone has drunk a lot of alcohol, they can say: I'm pickled - and when they've got problems, they can say: I'm in a pickle. Take The Hunger Games actor Liam Hemsworth, who said:\nClip 1: Most of the time if I'm in a pickle I'll call one of my brothers. They've usually got somewhat uplifting advice.\nClip 2: Ooh, you're in a pickle with those bags aren't you? Let me help.\nKing James I: Now Mr Shakespeare, sit down and eat with us. Have some cold meat!\nServant: Anything with that?\nWill: Hmmm… To pickle, or not to pickle: that is the question.",

		"title"		: "As dead as a doornail",
		"text"		: "Narrator: It was a cold morning. William Shakespeare is in the theatre, working on Henry VI part II, whilst his actor friend Thomas Swann is mending a broken door.\nWill: Thomas! Can you stop that banging? I'm trying to write here!\nThomas: Will, this door needs fixing properly. I have to hit this doornail hard… there. That will never come out.\nWill: What's that about a doornail? Hmmm… you've just given me an idea… dead as a doornail… dead as a doornail!\nThomas: Who's dead?! Will?\nWill: Thomas, I have the perfect line for your character… Jack Cade, the rebel leader, strong and proud. But in this scene, he's on the run, hiding from his enemies. He hasn't eaten anything for five days, except herbs… even grass… he's weak… alone… and suddenly, six of his enemies find him.\nThomas: So he's in danger…\nWill: Yes, but he doesn't show any fear: in fact, he threatens to kill all of them dead as a doornail. Come Thomas, let's read your lines. Look on me well: I have eat no meat…\nThomas as Jack Cade: Look on me well: I have eat no meat these five days; yet come thou and thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.\nWill: You have it! Well done Thomas: there's another classic Shakespeare line.\nThomas: I don't know how you do it, Will.\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. The phrase as dead as a doornail was in common use in Shakespeare's day. It means the same today as it did back then: Dead. Very dead. Totally dead. It's a very well-known English expression - for example, novelist Charles Dickens used it to describe the character Marley in A Christmas Carol:\nClip 1: Old Marley was as dead as a doornail.\nNarrator: These days we can use it for electrical gadgets that aren't working.\nClip 2: Oh no - I forgot to charge my phone. It's as dead as a doornail.\nWill: Right! All that writing has made me thirsty. Let us go to the Duck and Whistle. Come on Thomas, close the door behind you… Hmmm… perhaps you should put another couple of nails in that door before we go, Thomas?\nThomas: Ahh… To nail, or not to nail: that is the question.",

		"title"		: "I'll send him packing",
		"text"		: "Narrator: It's early morning at the Globe Theatre. William Shakespeare and his actors are rehearsing Henry IV Part 1. In this scene, it's late at night, and young Prince Hal, played by Robert Harley, and his friend Falstaff – that's Thomas Swann – are in the pub. But… the King's messenger has just arrived.\nThomas Swann as Falstaff: … Shall I give him his answer?\nRobert Harley as Prince Hal: Prithee do, Jack.\nThomas Swann as Falstaff: Faith and I'll send him packaged…\nWill: Stoooppppp!!! Thomas, Thomas, it's packing… I'll send him packing… Not packaged. You're not putting him in a box or a parcel. Remember: you want the King's messenger to go away!\nThomas Swann: Sorry, Will… I'm not my best today…\nActor 1: One too many beers last night, eh Thomas?!\nActor 2: He thinks he's Falstaff for real!\nWill: Thomas. Listen to me. Falstaff and Prince Hal are having a great time. That's why Hal doesn't want to see the messenger.\nRobert Harley: Will…\nWill: What is it, Robert?!\nRobert Harley: I do like the messenger's name: Gravity. Gravity! A serious man who doesn't like to have fun. Not like Falstaff. He's…\nActor 1: Old!\nActor 2: …and fat!\nActor 1: He's always telling jokes…\nActor 2: He's never got any money!\nThomas Swann: That last bit's true enough, Will.\nWill: Now, now Thomas – you're perfect for this part. The audience are going to love you! Let's go again, from: What doth Gravity do out of his bed at midnight?\nThomas Swann as Falstaff: What doth Gravity do out of his bed at midnight? Shall I give him his answer?\nRobert Harley as Prince Hal: Prithee do, Jack.\nThomas Swann as Falstaff: Faith, and I'll send him packing!\nWill: Bravo! Let's take a break.\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. Falstaff is one of Shakespeare's most popular characters. He drinks, steals and runs away from danger, but Shakespeare’s audiences loved his comic genius and sense of fun. In Henry IV, Prince Hal prefers the company of Falstaff – and his criminal friends – to noblemen. Shakespeare’s phrase I'll send him packing has the same meaning today: I really don't want this person around me, so I'll send them away. It's also used in sport, to talk about beating an opponent. Take Gwyn Jones, former captain of the Welsh rugby team, who said before a match:\nClip 1: This is our chance to do it and we should send them packing with their tails between their legs.\nClip 2: I've no patience when people try to sell me things at the door. I usually send them packing.\nWill: Let's try it once more.\nActor 1: Come on Thomas!\nActor 2: You can do it!\nThomas Swann: Will you all shush?!\nActors 1 & 2: To shush or not to shush, that is the question.",

		"title"		: "All that glisters is not gold",
		"text"		: "Narrator: It was a sunny afternoon. William Shakespeare is working on his play The Merchant of Venice. His daughter comes to see him.\nDaughter: Father, look at my new ring! Isn't it lovely, gold and shiny…\nWill: Dear daughter, it is very beautiful. Where did you get such a pretty thing?\nDaughter: From the market. It was much cheaper than the gold merchant!\nWill: Is it real gold?\nDaughter: Yes, of course!\nWill: So, my dear daughter, why is your finger green?\nDaughter: Oohhhh!\nWill: My dear daughter, you have a lot to learn… sit with me while I work. The Merchant of Venice. The Prince of Morocco wants to marry the beautiful Portia. But first, he must choose between three boxes: one made of gold, the second of silver, and the third, of cheap lead. Only one of the boxes contains a picture of Portia, and if the Prince chooses the wrong one, he cannot marry her. So, dear daughter, which box does he choose?\nDaughter: The gold box! Is it real gold?\nWill: He chooses the gold box indeed, and indeed it is real gold. The Prince believes that only the most beautiful box can hold the painting of the beautiful Portia. But in fact, it holds not a picture, but a scroll with these words: All that glisters is not gold…\nRobert Harley as The Prince of Morocco: All that glisters is not gold;: Often have you heard that told:: Many a man his life hath sold: But my outside to behold:\nDaughter: He thought that because the box is beautiful on the outside, something beautiful must be inside… he was wrong.\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. The Merchant of Venice is a play about money, money, money, and the phrase all that glisters is not gold warns us not to be fooled by people or things that look good - because they might not be as good as they look on the surface! In modern English, the word glisters is often changed to glistens or glitters. \nClip 1: Well that car looks fantastic, but all that glitters is not gold. Check the engine before you buy it.\nDaughter: Oh father, will you buy me a real gold ring? Pleeeeeaase?\nWill: Hmmm… to buy, or not to buy: that is the question.",

		"title"		: "Strange bedfellows",
		"text"		: "Narrator: It's late in the evening. William Shakespeare is visiting his actor friend Robert Harley.\nRobert: Will! Just one moment… I have to rescue the cat. It likes to sleep with the chickens and it gets locked in the henhouse… come on kitty…\nWill: The cat sleeps with the chickens? That's unusual.\nRobert Harley: It's strange, but they seem quite happy together. So, Will, I've read your new play The Tempest and I'm very excited about all the magic, the music and the monsters, and my character, Trinculo, the lost traveller: it's a wonderful part. His meeting with Caliban: it's very interesting.\nWill: Ah, yes, Caliban. Neither man nor fish – a weird sort of creature.\nRobert Harley: You put them both in a storm…\nWill: Yes: it's an old trick but it's a good way to bring them together. Trinculo needs shelter and the strange, well, almost monstrous Caliban is wearing a gaberdine: a large coat, big enough for both of them. Trinculo gets under it, safe and warm from the storm.\nRobert Harley: But Trinculo isn't happy…\nWill: He's feeling very miserable. He actually says: Alas, the storm is come again! My best way…\nRobert Harley as Trinculo: Alas, the storm is come again! My best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.\nWill: Ohh, I do like that line: Misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. When times are hard, people do things they don't normally do…\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. Shakespeare lived in a time of discovery – strange new lands and creatures, so the mysterious island of The Tempest appealed to Shakespeare's audience as both exciting and scary. These days, the phrase strange bedfellows describes two people or groups that are connected in a particular activity, even though they are very different and are not usually seen together. It's often used for political alliances. For example, a July 2015 report from US broadcaster Fox News described Israel and Hamas as strange bedfellows when they both wanted to stop the growth of so-called Islamic State in Gaza. The headline was:\nClip 1: Israel, Hamas strange bedfellows when it comes to reining in ISIS in Gaza.\nNarrator: Strange bedfellows is useful for all sorts of unlikely partnerships.\nClip 2: You think Miley Cyrus and Michael Bublé should write a song together? Well, they'd be strange bedfellows… but it might just work.\nRobert Harley: Now Will, it's getting late and there's a storm coming. You must stay with us tonight. You can sleep in the henhouse – or you can share a bed with the Harley family.\nWill: Hmmm… To bed or not to bed: that is the question.",

		"title"		: "Though this be madness, yet there is method in't",
		"text"		: "Narrator: It was late in the evening. Actors Thomas Swann and Robert Harley are having a drink in the Duck and Whistle after a rehearsal of William Shakespeare's Hamlet.\nBarmaid: Here you are Mr Robert, Mr Thomas: two more ales.\nThomas Swann: Now Robert, the big question in Hamlet for me is – oh, hello, Will.\nWill: Good evening Thomas, Robert…\nThomas Swann: Will. About your character Hamlet. Is he really mad?\nBarmaid: Good evening Mr Will – oohh, he's a tricky fellow that Hamlet. The way I see it, Mr Thomas, is, he's not really mad. He wants to find out who killed his father, and he thinks if he pretends to be mad, the killer will stop hiding the truth from him. Isn't that right Mr Will?\nWill: Indeed it is, Bess.\nBarmaid: Hamlet says all sorts of crazy things about maggots in dogs and crabs walking backwards… no wonder everyone thinks he's mad. I'm a big fan of yours, Mr Will.\nWill: Thank you, Bess.\nRobert Harley: But if Polonius thinks Hamlet is mad, why does he say: Though this be madness, yet there is method in't?\nBarmaid: Well I think, Mr Robert, that's partly because some of the crazy things that Hamlet says actually make sense. That's why Polonius thinks Hamlet is somehow in control of his madness, because Hamlet says: For yourself, sir, should be as old as I am…\nRobert Harley as Hamlet: For yourself, sir, should be as old as I am, if like a crab you could go backward.\nThomas Swann as Polonius: Though this be madness, yet there is method in't.\nBarmaid: That Polonius is an old fool – he doesn’t know Hamlet’s insulting him. I've seen all your plays, Mr Will.\nWill: I know you have, dear Bess.\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. The name Hamlet is very similar to Hamnet, Shakespeare's son, who died at just 11 years old. It's possible that Shakespeare's grief influenced the outpouring of hopelessness and grief in Hamlet's speeches that follow the death of his father, the King. The modern version of the phrase Though this be madness, yet there is method in't is simply: there's method in his madness – or her madness, or my madness – and it means: there's a sensible reason for something that seems crazy. Take snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan, talking about how his father introduced him to snooker. He said:\nClip 1: My dad's method in his madness was to try every sport and then observe what I liked. I played football, tennis, golf, cricket – but I loved my snooker.\nClip 2: My mum's desk is covered in papers. There's method in her madness, though. She knows where everything is!\nThomas Swann: So Hamlet isn't mad – he's just pretending.\nShakespeare: That's right – exactly.\nRobert Harley: This is one crazy plot…\nBarmaid: Mr Will knows what he's doing, believe me.\nRobert Harley: Hmm… To be-lieve or not to be-lieve:\nThomas Swann: …that is the question.",

Come in.\nDaughter: Good evening Mister Harley…\nRobert Harley: Miss Shakespeare… I'm sorry I’m late - I was out horse riding. It was wonderful - so fast, so exciting!\nWill: Ahhh, the wild-goose chase! Take care when you race that way young Robert, we don't want to spoil those good looks of yours…\nDaughter: Why is it called a wild-goose chase? It's a horse race! They're not chasing geese!\nWill: Dear daughter, a wild-goose chase is indeed a kind of horse race. The riders have to follow one horse, keeping up with him wherever he goes, just as wild geese follow the leader when they fly.\nDaughter: Ohhh… I expect you kept up with him very well, Robert…!\nWill: Thank you, daughter. Now to the play: Romeo and Juliet. Robert, you are playing Mercutio, Romeo's best friend. In this scene, there is a different kind of wild-goose chase. This chase is all about words and jokes. Mercutio and Romeo are competing with each other: each of them trying to tell the cleverest and funniest jokes.\nRobert: A competition of intelligence, of wits and quick thinking!\nDaughter: Mercutio will win, won't he!? He is handsome - and clever!\nWill: Mercutio is indeed quick-witted, but Romeo is better - much better, and Mercutio knows it - so he gives up this wild-goose chase before it even starts, saying: Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase…\nRobert as Mercutio: Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done,: for thou hast more of the wild goose in one of: thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five.\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. Romeo and Juliet is a play about young love, but it also has lots of fighting, with both weapons and words. Here, Shakespeare compares Romeo and Mercutio's duelling with words to a wild and dangerous horse race, called a wild-goose chase. In modern English, a wild-goose chase isn't about horses, or geese: it describes a situation where you foolishly chase after something that is impossible to get - or doesn't exist at all. Take US writer Bryant McGill, who said:\nClip 1: Endless consumerism sends us on a wild-goose chase for happiness through materialism.\nClip 2: We looked for the restaurant for hours, but it was a wild-goose chase: turned out that it closed down years ago!\nRobert: So, no wild-goose chase for Mercutio.\nDaughter: You could chase me, though Robert…\nRobert: Oh dear… to chase, or not to chase: that really isn't a question.",

		"title"		: "The world's mine oyster",
		"text"		: "Narrator: The year is 1599. William Shakespeare is at the palace of Queen Elizabeth I of England. The Queen has ordered Shakespeare to write another play.\nQueen Elizabeth I: Mr Shakespeare. Tell me about my new play.\nWill: Your Majesty, The Merry Wives of Windsor is a comedy, in which Sir John Falstaff tries to trick two married ladies into giving him money behind their husbands' backs.\nQueen Elizabeth I: Falstaff! Hahaha! He is such a wicked man... that's why I like him. Or maybe he reminds me of our dear friend Sir Walter Raleigh, who brings me treasure from around the world. Look at my pearls, taken from a Spanish ship by Raleigh and brought to me as a gift.\nWill: They are beautiful, your Majesty. Whoever could guess that such a creature, deep in the ocean, could contain the most beautiful, precious treasure: a pearl?!\nQueen Elizabeth I: Yessss... to Raleigh, the whole world is an oyster... full of treasure, ready for the taking. By force if need be... he is not afraid to use the sword to bring me my treasure.\nWill: Mr Raleigh is your loyal servant, your Majesty, as am I.\nQueen Elizabeth I: To Falstaff. What of his trickery?\nWill: Your Majesty, while Falstaff is trying to get money from the wives, his friend Pistol is trying to get money out of him!\nQueen Elizabeth I: Hahaha! Does he get it?\nWill: Falstaff tells Pistol he won't give him a penny. Pistol becomes angry and says he'll get his sword and open up Falstaff's money bag - or any money bag he can find - like he's opening an oyster with a knife! It goes like this. I will not lend thee a penny...\nThomas Swann as Falstaff: I will not lend thee a penny.\nRobert Harley as Pistol: Why, then the world's mine oyster.: Which I with sword will open. \nQueen Elizabeth I: The world's mine oyster. It's full of money and treasure. Quite right, Mr Shakespeare, quite right.\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now. The Merry Wives of Windsor was Shakespeare's only comedy to be set entirely in England, and it's considered to be his most realistic portrayal of the daily lives of ordinary people. Think of it as the original 'Real Housewives'. In Shakespeare's play, the phrase the world's mine oyster was used as a threat - but today, it has become the world's my oyster - or your oyster - and it describes situations that contain wonderful opportunities. Take US entrepreneur Chris Gardner, who wrote in his autobiography The Pursuit of Happyness:\nClip 1: The world is your oyster. It's up to you to find the pearls.\nNarrator: It can describe the opportunities that open up when you take risks, have money or learn new skills.\nClip 2: If you learn foreign languages, the world's your oyster.\nQueen Elizabeth I: Mr Shakespeare, I am pleased. Your actors will perform this play for me.\nWill: To perform, or not to perform: I'll just do what she tells me.",

He's rehearsing the role of King Richard in Shakespeare's Richard III.\nThomas: The King's name is a tower of strength... Hmmm. I could play it quietly: The King's name is a tower of strength... or angrily: The King's name is a tower of strength...\nBarmaid: Here you go Mr Will, Mr Thomas, two more ales.\nThomas: Will, how should I play this line? What is Richard's motivation here?\nWill: Thomas, Thomas, don't you understand? King Richard is about to go into battle. The opposing army has six or seven thousand men.\nThomas: That's a lot of men!\nWill: Richard is not afraid. He has three times that number of soldiers.\nThomas: Twenty thousand men - that's a big army!\nWill: Yes, but Richard has something more powerful than even the greatest army. He has his name: King Richard. That name makes him strong; powerful. It makes ordinary people fear and respect him.\nThomas: So the name King Richard is as strong as a tower...\nWill: Exactly. Richard's enemies don't have that.\nThomas: So this line needs strength and confidence.\nWill: Yes. This play is about power - and what people will do to get it. Let us rehearse. I am Norfolk, your general. Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.\nThomas Swann as Richard III: Why, our battalion trebles that account. Besides, the King's name is a tower of strength\nWhich they upon the adverse party want.\nWill: You have it! Well done! I'll drink to that. Another jug of ale! \nBarmaid: Here you are, sir.\nNarrator: We'll leave them there for now.

Of course, these days, you don't have to kill your family to be described as a tower of strength - you just have to be strong, reliable, trustworthy, dependable and good in a crisis. Like footballer David Beckham, who said:\nClip 1: Alex Ferguson was like a father to me. He was a tower of strength.\nClip 2: My husband was a tower of strength when I had that operation - he really looked after me well.\nBarmaid: Mr Will, a message from your wife. She says if you're not home in five minutes, don't bother coming home ever again.\nThomas: The old ball and chain at it again, eh? Come on Will, have another beer!\nWill: Hmmm...
