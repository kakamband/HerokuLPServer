		"text"		: "\n\nNarrator\nIt was a chilly November evening. William Shakespeare's play The Tempest, full of music, magic and monsters, is being performed for the first time. King James I and the Queen are having dinner while they watch.\n\nKing James\nI do like a good play… mmm… and this meat is delicious - bring me more of that pickle… Mmmm… I love a bit of pickle with my dinner… and a nice glass of wine…\n\nQueen\nDon't you think you've had enough wine, dear?\n\nKing James\nOh do be quiet dear: I can't hear the actors. Now, Mr Shakespeare, is that a King I see on the stage?\n\nWill\nYour Majesty, that is King Alonso of Naples. He is lost on a magical island.\n\nKing James\nAnd who is this fellow in the jester's costume?\n\nWill\nYour Majesty, that is Trinculo. He drinks a lot, and plans to murder people.\n\nKing James\nA drunken jester? Murder? No good will come of it… does the King know about this?\n\nWill\nYes, your Majesty. Now, the King is going to find Trinculo - in a drunken mess. Your Majesty might care to listen…\n\nKing James 1\nOoh yes, yes, I want to hear this, be quiet everybody.\n \nAlonso\nHow camest thou in this pickle?\n\nRobert Harley as Trinculo\nI have been in such a pickle since I saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.\n\nKing James 1\nHahaha! He's in a pickle! I like it, Will, very good, very good!\n\nNarrator\nWe'll leave them there for now. Pickles are a very messy food, made from fruit and vegetables, crushed and preserved in vinegar and spices - sometimes with alcohol too. When Trinculo says he is in a pickle, he's probably saying that he is very drunk - but he's also got himself into a mess - a very difficult situation. Nowadays, when someone has drunk a lot of alcohol, they can say: I'm pickled - and when they've got problems, they can say: I'm in a pickle. Take The Hunger Games actor Liam Hemsworth, who said:\n\nClip 1\nMost of the time if I'm in a pickle I'll call one of my brothers. They've usually got somewhat uplifting advice.\n\nClip 2\nOoh, you're in a pickle with those bags aren't you? Let me help.\n\nKing James I\nNow Mr Shakespeare, sit down and eat with us. Have some cold meat!\n\nServant\nAnything with that?\n\nWill\nHmmm… To pickle, or not to pickle: that is the question.\n",
