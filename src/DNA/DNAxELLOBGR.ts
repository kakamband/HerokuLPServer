		"text"		: "Sarah: John, tell me about your day. What time do you wake-up?\nJohn: Well, let's see. Some days I wake up early. Maybe about 6 o'clock. Yeah, sometimes I wake up at 6 o'clock.\nWhen I get up early, I like to get ready for the day, take a shower and have breakfast. But other days, I don't like getting up early. Maybe I'll sleep in until 10:00 or 11:00.\nSarah: Wow.\nJohn: Yeah. I like sleeping in late. So sometimes, I wake up at 11:00. On those days, if I know I won't wake up until 11:00, I'll take a shower the night before, before I go to bed. How about you, Sarah? When do you usually wake up?\nSarah: Well, I like everyday to be the same. So I wake up everyday at 8 o'clock.\nJohn: 8:00.\nSarah: 8:00. And I always do the same thing. First, I make coffee right away. Then I wake up my kids and we have breakfast together at about 8:30.\nJohn: Really?\nSarah: Yes. We usually have something easy like bread and yogurt and fruit.\nJohn: I like to have coffee every morning whether I wake up at 6:00 or at 10:00. I'm still going to have coffee. But I often skip breakfast. Do you always eat breakfast everyday?\nSarah: Yes. If I don't eat breakfast, I'm so hungry. What about lunch? What time do you have lunch?\nJohn: Lunch is the same everyday for me. I always eat lunch at 12:30 PM. So whenever I wake up, I do some things and then I always have lunch at 12:30 PM, just half past noon. And I always have a simple lunch. Maybe some soup or spaghetti or a sandwich. Something light, and it's always at half past noon. What time do you eat lunch?\nSarah: That's interesting. I have breakfast at the same time everyday but lunch is always at a different time.\nJohn: Really?\nSarah: Because I'm busy in the morning. I go out, maybe I go shopping. Sometimes, I clean the house. So I might have lunch at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock. Sometimes as late as 2:30.\nJohn: Oh, that's getting late.\nSarah: Yes. But it's always easy lunch like you. Maybe crackers and cheese or a sandwich or a baked potato.\nJohn: I see.",
