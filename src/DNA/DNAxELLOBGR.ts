Yeah, sometimes I wake up at 6 o'clock.\nWhen I get up early, I like to get ready for the day, take a shower and have breakfast. But other days, I don't like getting up early. Maybe I'll sleep in until 10:00 or 11:00.\nSarah: Wow.\nJohn: Yeah. I like sleeping in late. So sometimes, I wake up at 11:00. On those days, if I know I won't wake up until 11:00, I'll take a shower the night before, before I go to bed. How about you, Sarah? When do you usually wake up?\nSarah: Well, I like everyday to be the same. So I wake up everyday at 8 o'clock.\nJohn: 8:00.\nSarah: 8:00. And I always do the same thing. First, I make coffee right away. Then I wake up my kids and we have breakfast together at about 8:30.\nJohn: Really?\nSarah: Yes. We usually have something easy like bread and yogurt and fruit.\nJohn: I like to have coffee every morning whether I wake up at 6:00 or at 10:00. I'm still going to have coffee. But I often skip breakfast. Do you always eat breakfast everyday?\nSarah: Yes. If I don't eat breakfast, I'm so hungry. What about lunch? What time do you have lunch?\nJohn: Lunch is the same everyday for me. I always eat lunch at 12:30 PM. So whenever I wake up, I do some things and then I always have lunch at 12:30 PM, just half past noon. And I always have a simple lunch. Maybe some soup or spaghetti or a sandwich. Something light, and it's always at half past noon. What time do you eat lunch?\nSarah: That's interesting. I have breakfast at the same time everyday but lunch is always at a different time.\nJohn: Really?\nSarah: Because I'm busy in the morning. I go out, maybe I go shopping. Sometimes, I clean the house. So I might have lunch at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock. Sometimes as late as 2:30.\nJohn: Oh, that's getting late.\nSarah: Yes. But it's always easy lunch like you. Maybe crackers and cheese or a sandwich or a baked potato.\nJohn: I see.",

When do you eat dinner?\nJohn: My dinner time varies a lot just like my breakfast. So maybe I eat dinner later than most people. I think I would have dinner at 7:00 PM at the earliest. But sometimes, I will have dinner as late as 9 o'clock at night.\nSarah: Really?\nJohn: Yeah. I don't mind it. I really like cooking so, if I'm cooking a short thing, I'll have dinner earlier. But I don't mind if it takes two hours to cook something really good, I'll eat later at night.\nSarah: Wow. Can you tell me about your work routine? What time do you usually go to work?\nJohn: See, my work schedule is different everyday. That's why I wake up at a different time everyday. Maybe on – for example, some weeks on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, I start work at 7:00. But on Thursday and Friday, I don't start work until 11:30.\nSarah: Ah.\nJohn: How about you? Do you have a different work time sometimes?\nSarah: Well, right now, I'm on maternity leave. So I stay home and take care of my new baby.\nJohn: Oh, congratulations.\nSarah: Thank you. I try to work at home a little bit everyday though. If the kids are sleeping or they're playing quietly, I try to do some work. Maybe around 2 o'clock, I can usually get some work done because the kids are sleeping.\nJohn: Oh, if you don't start getting some work done until 2 o'clock in the afternoon, you must be very busy every morning.\nSarah: Yeah. I usually go to the grocery store. Sometimes I take the kids to the park around 10:00 in the morning. I often do the laundry or wash the dishes, and then as soon as the dishes are washed, it's time to make lunch. So I'm busy all day.\nJohn: I see. So that's why your lunch time can change so much.\nSarah: Yeah.\nJohn: Oh, it sounds like a busy day.",

So because she doesn't eat or drink all these foods, it's kind of hard if we go out to dinner or if I want to eat something because then I feel guilty.\nMeg: Do you also not eat those foods?\nTodd: No. Are you kidding?

I'll give it a try. But the thing is, you know, she – there's one other problem. She eats five small meals a day, so never eats big meals. So we can't go to a restaurant and stuff like that. So it's just really hard to adjust. I mean, I love a big breakfast, you know. She never eats a big breakfast.

		"text"		: "Meg: Hey, Todd, I want to go to Osaka. What's the best way?\nTodd: The best way, you know, it kind of depends on your time and your cost, and your comfort. The easiest might be the ferry. So the ferry leaves everyday at 7 o'clock. And it goes overnight and it arrives in Osaka at I think 6 o'clock in the morning. So it's a nice trip. You're on the boat. You could kind of have dinner on the boat. You go to sleep and then you wake up, and then you're there. And it costs about $70.\nMeg: Sounds pretty good.\nTodd: Yeah. It's good. Yeah. But you sleep in a big area with other people. So it's like a shared sleeping area.\nMeg: Right. What are some other ways?\nTodd: Well, if you have lots of money, you can take the train. The train is convenient because it leaves every hour from the downtown station and it takes about four hours, three and a half hours. You have to transfer the train once. But it leaves every hour. It costs a little bit. It costs, you know, about 300 bucks. But it's an enjoyable ride and, you know, you're never stuck in traffic.\nMeg: So ferry, train; what else?\nTodd: You can take a plane. There are two flights. One flight leaves early in the morning, another flight leaves in the afternoon. And that's probably the fastest because if you fly there, it only takes one hour. But it takes 30 minutes to get to the airport. It's outside of town. And then you have to get there an hour early for your flight and check in your bags and stuff. So it still takes door-to-door probably 45 hours. And also flights, they can be cheap, but they're about 100 bucks.\nMeg: Oh, okay. Are there any other ways?\nTodd: There's one other way. The cheapest way is actually going by bus. The good thing is, you know, the busses leave every hour. But you must take a bus to Fukuoka and then transfer in Fukuoka. And it takes a long time. It takes about eight hours to get there. But it only costs about 50 bucks. And there are some busses that go overnight.\nMeg: That sounds pretty good. Well, I like to save money but the bus sounds a little boring. So maybe I'd rather sleep on the ferry.\nTodd: Yeah. I think the ferry is the way to go.\nMeg: Thanks.",

I can speak only enough to go to the grocery or ask when the bus leaves or buy a train ticket.\nTodd: Yeah. It's difficult. It's hard to have a good conversation in Japanese. But I can read Japanese. I studied Kanji.\nSarah: Oh really?\nTodd: So my reading is okay, but my speaking is just really bad. I have bad pronunciation. So because my Japanese pronunciation is not very good, Japanese people don't like to speak Japanese with me, I think.\nSarah: My Spanish pronunciation is really bad because I always spoke with other foreigners who are also studying Spanish. So there would be a Korean person, me, a Norwegian person, and we were all speaking Spanish together. So we all had bad pronunciation.\nTodd: Yeah.\nSarah: What about Thai?\nTodd: Yeah. I can speak Thai. My Thai is different. My Thai pronunciation is okay. So I can have conversations in Thai. I lived in Thailand when I was young, so – or I was 22 to 26. So I studied it and I like Thai. But reading in Thai is difficult for me.\nSo I can read Japanese better than I can read Thai but I can speak Thai better, and my Thai listening is better also.\nSarah: Ah.

So it's nice.\nSarah: Oh great.\nTodd: What about you? Do you want to live in Ecuador, again?\nSarah: Not Ecuador. I love Ecuador but I want to live in another Spanish-speaking country. I'd like to live in Argentina, maybe or Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is part of America but they speak Spanish there.\nTodd: Yeah. I hear Puerto Rico is really nice.\nSarah: Yeah. I went there for one week and it was just amazing. It has beaches and mountains, and the people are really fun. And it's a really exciting place to visit.",

So it always works.\nSo yeah.\nSarah: How about the Nokia?\nTodd: The Nokia is also a good phone. It's a Windows phone, and I travel a lot so when I travel, I always take the Nokia phone and I use a new sim card in the country, and that is my phone when I travel.\nI usually leave my Galaxy phone or my iPhone at home.\nSarah: You say you use your phone for work. How?\nTodd: So I create websites and so I need to check how websites look on different phones. So every time I make a website, I check it on the Nokia phone. I check it on the Samsung phone. I check on the iPhone. So I make sure the website works on all smartphones.\nSarah: Does the website often have problems with one phone or a different phone?\nTodd: Usually not. Usually, everything is okay. But sometimes, media files like audio files or video files do not work on the phones. So sometimes, I have to change things. But usually, it works.\nSarah: Ah.\nTodd: How about you? How many computers do you have?\nSarah: Well, at home, we have one laptop. And it's kind of big, so I don't usually take it out with me. And then we have a personal computer, and we also have a tablet, an iPad.\nTodd: Oh yeah.\nSarah: And I don't use the iPad very much. It's usually used by my daughter.

Who do you get on well with in your family?\nAkane: Well, I think I get along the best with my mother, I would say.\nRuth: So, why is that?\nAkane: Well, I think it probably has to do with the fact that we're both female. I mean the only other people in my family are my father and my brother.\nRuth: So, what does your mom look like?\nAkane: Well, she's actually taller than me. She has dark hair and a pretty firm build. Um, she's not too thin and not too fat, and yeah!\nRuth: And what does your mom do? Does she have a job?\nAkane: Oh, good question. She's actually a hair dresser. Yeah, so she does my hair and she's also an aesthetician as well so I get free skin care products from her.\nRuth: Oh, that's fantastic. So what does your mom like to do when she is not working?\nAkane: Well, she used to take sewing lessons, so she really likes to sew things like her own curtains and she even made me some clothes a few times.\nRuth: Wow, so she's talented.\nAkane: Yeah, she's quite artistic.\nRuth: So when did you last see your mom or speak to your mom?\nAkane: Well, the last time I saw her was this spring. I stayed at my parents house for about a week and, yeah, that's when I saw her.\nRuth: Was that a couple of months ago?\nAkane: Yeah, a couple of months ago, that's right.\nRuth: And what was the last thing your mom bought for you?\nAkane: Actually, just before I came here, we went shopping together and because I have to fly away to a new country she bought me some new clothes. She bought me a new coat actually.\nRuth: Wow, that's really nice. Well, thanks for that Akane.",

		"text"		: "Akane's Vacation\nLast year, I went to Portugal just after Christmas. And I stayed there until… well, just after New Year's this year. In Portugal, I met up with one of my friends from Toronto. He had family that lived in Portugal, because his family was originally from Portugal.\nSo, they were kind enough to let me stay with them. I didn’t know any Portuguese, except for some simple words like “hello”, and “thank you”. I learned some simple words through an audio CD, before I went there. And the people that I stayed with didn’t know very much English either. However, we got along surprisingly well.\nThey were surprised that I was able to eat some of their exotic foods. They made some delicious meals every single day, like octopus, tripe and rabbit. It is quite exotic, but I thought it was quite good. They also made some excellent desserts, like crème caramel, and a rich sponge cake that they call Paon d’lo.: Howard's Vacation\nOK, now I'll talk about my winter vacation. This winter vacation I spent two weeks in my hometown which is Daytona Beach, Florida. It was wonderful. The weather was warm every day. It was sunny every day and the temperature was almost 80 degrees.\nI visited my mother and I spent every morning having a nice leisurely cup of coffee and reading the newspaper and after that I got my bicycle out and and rode down to the beach and enjoyed the sun and the surf, and came back home and read a book and went to bed early.\nI had a wonderful time. I saw a couple of new movies, when I was home in Florida. I saw The Aviator and also an interesting movie called Spanglish, which I hope you all can see because it's an interesting movie about English and the Spanish.",
