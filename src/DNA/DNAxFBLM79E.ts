The headache is in the back of his head. That is where his headaches usually are. Sometimes he has headaches on the top of his head. Sometimes he has headaches in the front of his head. Sometimes his headaches are between his eyes. Sometimes his whole head hurts. But usually the back of his head hurts. His headache started while he was reading. Reading causes headaches for him. He hates his headaches, but he loves to read. He reads for only 15 minutes. Then he stops reading. He takes a break. If he reads for 16 minutes, he’ll get a headache. So he tries to take a break every 15 minutes. But sometimes he forgets to take his break. Today he forgot to take a break. Now he must wait until the headache goes away. It will take an hour or two. Then he can read again. But right now he must live with the pain. ",

She found a talk show to watch. It was Ellen. She liked Ellen. Ellen was a comedian. She told good jokes. She showed animals doing funny things. She gave expensive gifts to her fans occasionally. This show was a rerun, because Ellen’s \"live\" show was usually on at 4 o’clock. But that didn’t matter to Emily. All she wanted to do was relax. Her life was one problem after another. Her husband had just lost his job. Her only child had dropped out of high school. Even worse, he had left home. He told his mom he would call from time to time. But he hadn’t called in two weeks. She was worried sick. She didn’t know where he was. She didn’t know if he was dead or alive. Her husband said she shouldn’t worry. He had done the same thing when he was 17. But when he found out that life on the road wasn’t as easy as he thought it was, he returned home and got his high school diploma. ",

One was her bank. Opposite the bank was a fast food restaurant. The other two buildings were a dry cleaner and an office building. Before she arrived at the corner, she could smell the fried chicken. The restaurant was open seven days a week, and the odor of fried chicken was in the neighborhood daily. She was a vegetarian. She used to eat meat and fish. But that was before she found a dead cat in her dumpster one day. Of course, she had smelled the dead cat before she opened the dumpster lid. Everyone knows the smell of dead flesh. She knew that something in the dumpster was dead, but she didn’t know what. Just in case it was a human (some people dump their babies into dumpsters), she opened the lid. She saw the cat. Flies covered most of it. They were enjoying their meal. She loved cats. She had two of her own. A week later at a restaurant, she ordered a hamburger. She took one bite out of it, and almost gagged. She spit it out. All she could think about was the smell of that dead cat. That was the day she became a vegetarian. ",

He turned left and walked over to the produce section. Today was his lucky day. Apples were on sale, a dollar a pound. Usually they were two dollars a pound or more. He put 10 apples into a plastic bag and weighed the bag. It was three pounds. He walked over to the bananas. They were the regular price, 79 cents a pound. He bought three pounds of bananas. When he saw the carrots, he remembered that he needed carrots, too. He put a two-pound bag of carrots into his cart. They were only $1.29. He walked to the dairy section and saw that a gallon of milk was $4. He put one into his cart and walked back to the front of the store.

The restaurant closed at 10 p.m. She did not want to be stuck in the parking lot late at night if her car didn’t start. Her mechanic wasn’t open on weekends.
