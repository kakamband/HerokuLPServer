Have a nice day!\"\nArnie heard the baker say to the man.\n\n41\n00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,540\n\"Mr. Bing... that's a fine name,\" Arnie decided. \"I can hardly wait to meet him!\"\n\n42\n00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,180\n\"Good-bye Arnie!\"\n\"We'll miss you!\"\n\n43\n00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,120\n\"I should have talked to him while I had the chance.\"\n\n44\n00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,800\nThe ride to Mr. Bing's apartment was a little bumpy.\n\n45\n00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,700\nArnie was grateful for the soft napkin the baker had so thoughtfully placed underneath him in the bag.\n\n46\n00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,420\nHe had never ridden in a car and wished he could look out the window to see all the sights.\n\n47\n00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,340\nBut more than anything, he wished he could meet Mr. Bing.\n\n48\n00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,160\n\"Why does he keep me in this bag?\" Arnie wondered.\n\n49\n00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,280\nFinally, the car came to a stop and they were home.\n\n50\n00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,200\nMr. Bing carefully removed Arnie from his paper bag and placed him on a clean, shiny plate.\n\n51\n00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,100\n\"What a handsome plate,\" Arnie said to himself.\n\n52\n00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,700\n\"I'm not crazy about the design-- I prefer a more modern look. But it's nothing a little paint can't fix.\"\n\n53\n00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,440\nMr. Bing gently lifted Arnie from his new plate.\n\n54\n00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,520\n\"Isn't that cute?\" thought Arnie, as he closed his eyes and smiled. \"He wants to hold me.\"\n\n55\n00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,760\nAs Arnie relaxed in Mr. Bing's hand, he felt himself moving higher and higher away from his plate.\n\n56\n00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:06,920\nWhen he opened his eyes to see where he was going, he discovered that he was headed straight for Mr. Bing's open mouth!\n\n57\n00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,520\n\"What are you doing?\" shouted Arnie.\n\n58\n00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,300\nMr. Bing was stunned. He dropped Arnie back onto the plate.\n\n59\n00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,520\n\"I was going to... eat you,\" he replied in shock.\n\n60\n00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,440\n\"Eat me?\" Arnie shrieked, his sprinkles flying everywhere.\n\n61\n00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,340\n\"Why would you do a thing like that? Do you make a habit of eating all your houseguests?\"\n\n62\n00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,460\n\"No... of course not.\"\n\n63\n00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,040\n\"So, why then did it suddenly occur to you to eat me?\" Arnie demanded.\n\n64\n00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,640\n\"Well... because... you're a doughnut.\n\n65\n00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,140\nThat's what doughnuts are for-- to eat.\"\n\n66\n00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,440\n\"Do you mean to tell me you've done this before?\"\n\n67\n00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,320\n\"Yes... I eat a doughnut every day,\" Mr. Bing said sheepishly.\n\n68\n00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,820\nArnie froze. He felt sick and frightened\n\n69\n00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,540\n\"I'd better get out of here before he tries to eat me again!\"\n\n70\n00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,620\nand angry!\n\n71\n00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,700\n\"My friends have probably all been eaten!\"\n\n72\n00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,280\nHe thought to himself for a moment.\n\n73\n00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,920\n\"I must put a stop to this right away! I'll call the bakery and warn the others. Whoever's left, that is!\"\n\n74\n00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,740\nArnie knew that there was no time to waste and that he needed to be very sneaky in order to keep his plan from Mr. Bing.\n\n75\n00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,760\nHe turned to Mr. Bing and said in his sweetest voice,\n\n76\n00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:37,380\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I don't believe we've been properly introduced. My name is Arnie.\"\n\n77\n00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,980\n\"Um... hello... Arnie,\" Mr. Bing stammered.\n\n78\n00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,440\n\"I'm Mr. Bing.

Do you remember me?\n\n84\n00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,280\nYou made me at 5:15 this morning, and I was bought about twenty minutes ago\n\n85\n00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520\nby a man who goes by the name of Mr. Bing.\"\n\n86\n00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,880\n\"Yes, Arnie,\" the baker answered. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n87\n00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,940\n\"Now, I don't want to alarm you, but just moments ago, that man tried to eat me!\n\n88\n00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,760\nAnd not only that-- he claims to have eaten hundreds of us!\n\n89\n00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,760\nI'm going to make a run for it, but I wanted to warn you so that if you see him coming into the bakery again, you can stop him!\"\n\n90\n00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,920\n\"Oh my, Arnie-- I thought you understood. That's why I make doughnuts... for people to eat.\"\n\n91\n00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:02,300\n\"I can't believe it!\" Arnie gasped. \"Are the other doughnuts aware of this arrangement?\"\n\n92\n00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,320\n\"Well, I think so,\" the baker said. \"Let me ask them to make sure.\"\n\n93\n00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,120\nThe baker yelled to the other doughnuts, \"Do you doughnuts know that you're going to be eaten?\"\n\n94\n00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,000\n\"Yes, we know!\" the doughnuts shouted back.\n\"We're delicious! I don't blame them.\"\n\n95\n00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,160\n\"Did you hear that, Arnie?\" the baker asked.\n\n96\n00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,500\nArnie was crushed. The phone dropped from his hand.\n\n97\n00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,980\nHe'd heard all he needed to hear.\n\n98\n00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,420\nArnie forgot all about his plan to escape.\n\n99\n00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,480\nHe collapsed back onto the plate, glanced up at Mr. Bing, and muttered,\n\n100\n00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,760\n\"All right then, let's get this over with. Go ahead and eat me.\"\n\n101\n00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:54,240\nMr. Bing gazed down at Arnie. \"I'm not going to eat you, Arnie,\" he said reassuringly.\n\n102\n00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,000\n\"I just wouldn't feel right about it now.\"\n\n103\n00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,860\n\"Really?\" Arnie said, with a huge sigh of relief.\n\n104\n00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,620\n\"Well, I'm glad to see that you've come to your senses!\"\n\n105\n00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,840\n\"But since I'm not going to eat you,\" Mr. Bing continued, \"I'll have to figure out something else to do with you.\n\n106\n00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,900\nI paid good money for you-- I don't want to be wasteful.\"\n\n107\n00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,140\n\"Of course not!\" Arnie agreed.\n\n108\n00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,520\n\"What we need to do is each make a list of things I can do with you instead of eating you.\n\n109\n00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,480\nBetween the two of us, I know we'll come up with something.\"\n\n110\n00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:36,040\n\"Good plan, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie said. \"This will be a breeze-- I bet I'm good at lots of stuff!\"\n\n111\n00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,140\nThey both feverishly wrote down their ideas.\n\n112\n00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,940\nWhen they were finished, Mr. Bing asked, \"Would you like to read yours first?\"\n\n113\n00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,720\n\"Sure thing, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie answered.\n\n114\n00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320\nThings Mr. Bing can Do with Me Instead of Eating Me\n\n115\n00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,600\n\"Do you need a ballroom dance partner?\"\n\n116\n00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,240\n\"No, I don't dance.\"\n\n117\n00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300\n\"You could use a personal fitness trainer.\"\n\n118\n00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,580\n\"Hmm, I'd get too sweaty.\"\n\n119\n00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,120\n\"How about a portrait painter?\"\n\n120\n00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,560\n\"Oh, heavens no!\"\n\n121\n00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,440\n\"Would you like me to entertain you at parties?\"\n\n122\n00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,980\n\"Doughnut make my brown eyes bluuue...\"\n\n123\n00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,080\n\"I don't like throwing parties.\"\n\n124\n00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,620\n\"I could be your chauffeur.\"\n\n125\n00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,920\n\"But you can't see over the steering wheel.\"\n\n126\n00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680\n\"I'd make a great bodyguard!\"\n\n127\n00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,160\n\"Who could you protect me from-- a cookie?\"\n\n128\n00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,940\n\"All righty, Mr. Bing.

They felt terribly disappointed.\n\n145\n00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,620\nAfter a few minutes of awkward silence, Mr. Bing finally spoke.\n\n146\n00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,320\n\"I'm sorry, Arnie-- but it's clear that we can't agree on anything for you to do around here.\n\n147\n00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,800\nThis is difficult for me to say, but I think it would be best if you found another home.\"\n\n148\n00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,460\n\"I know,\" said Arnie, fighting back tears. \"I'll just be on my way then.\n\n149\n00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,660\nIs it all right if I keep this napkin to pack up all my loose sprinkles?\"\n\n150\n00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,420\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Bing replied sadly.\n\n151\n00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,560\n\"As soon as I get a job, I'll pay you back the money you spent on me.\"\n\n152\n00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800\n\"That's not necessary, Arnie.\"\n\n153\n00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,680\nArnie shook Mr. Bing's hand and thanked him for his kindness.\n\n154\n00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,980\nMr. Bing opened the door, and as Arnie left he paused and said,\n\n155\n00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,600\n\"I guess doughnuts really are only good for eating, aren't they?\"\n\n156\n00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,120\nThey both waved good-bye and Arnie was gone.\n\n157\n00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360\nMr. Bing stood at the window and watched as Arnie walked away.\n\n158\n00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,940\nHe walked past the flower beds, the mailboxes, and the apartment manager's office.\n\n159\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,100\n\"Is there anything worse than a sad pastry?\"\n\n160\n00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:35,100\nHe passed the tennis court, the swimming pool, and the clubhouse.\n\n161\n00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,200\n--\"Oh my gosh, is that a doughnut?\"\n\n162\n00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:48,040\nBut when Arnie reached the \"No Dogs Allowed\" sign at the end of the driveway, Mr. Bing suddenly came up with a new idea.\n\n163\n00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,380\n\"Arnie! Wait up! Arnie!\" yelled Mr. Bing as he ran after him.\n\n164\n00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,480\nArnie turned back and stopped. When Mr. Bing caught up with him, he was out of breath.\n\n165\n00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,520\n\"I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier!\" Mr. Bing panted.\n\n166\n00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,800\n\"Arnie, I've always wanted a dog--\n\n167\n00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,140\n\"Keep talkin', big guy.\"\n\n168\n00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,020\n\"--and could never have one because they're not allowed here.\n\n169\n00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,100\nBut there's no sign that says \"No Doughnuts Allowed.\"\n\n170\n00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,240\nArnie perked up when he realized what Mr. Bing was thinking.\n\n171\n00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,000\n\"Would you like to take walks and play fetch?\" Mr. Bing asked excitedly.\n\n172\n00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,760\n\"You bet I would!\"\n\n173\n00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,760\n\"Can you do tricks, like rolling over?\"\n\n174\n00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,180\n\"Rolling over? Look at me-- I was made for rolling over!\"\n\n175\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,480\n\"Well, then, there's only one thing left to ask. Arnie, will you be my doughnut-dog?\"\n\n176\n00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,180\n\"Oh, Mr. Bing-- I would love to be your doughnut-dog!\"\n\n177\n00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,280\nFrom that moment on, Arnie and Mr. Bing were inseparable.\n\n178\n00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,200\nArnie liked being a doughnut-dog even better than he liked being a doughnut!\n\n179\n00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,200\n\"Arf! Arf! Arf!\"\n\n180\n00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,740\nHe went through a short phase of chewing on furniture and barking at the mailmain,\n\n181\n00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,360\nbut after a crash course in obedience school, he graduated first in his class.\n\n182\n00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:13,420\nEverywhere the two of them went, people would stop to pet Arnie. No one had ever seen a doughnut-dog before.\n\n183\n00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,180\n--\"Oh, what a darling man.\"\n--\"What a darling dog!\"\n\n184\n00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,940\nArnie and Mr. Bing had so much fun together.\n\n185\n00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,980\nArnie was the best pet Mr. Bing could ever have hoped for-- and Mr. Bing was Arnie's best friend.\n\n186\n00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,740\nThe end.\n\n187\n00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:41,120\nI chose this book because it illustrates that two people who come from very different backgrounds,\n\n188\n00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,620\nthe eater and the eat-ee--\n\n189\n00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,840\n-- can come together and compromise.\n\n190\n00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,280\nAnd decide that together, eating doesn't need to take place at all, they can just be friends.\n\n191\n00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,420\nSometimes, you're the eater. Sometimes, you're the eaten.\n\n192\n00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,620\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n193\n00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,680\nHope you enjoyed it.\n\n194\n00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,940\nPlease feel free to check out some of our other terrific stories.\n\n195\n00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,900\nKeep reading, keep watching, keep eating.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:12,900\nHi, I'm Al Gore and this is part of the BookPALS program, sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:24,460\nAnd today, I'm going to read you this book, written and illustrated by William Steig, it's called \"Brave Irene.\"\n\n3\n00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,340\nHere's how it begins...\n\n4\n00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:40,820\nMrs. Bobbin, the dressmaker, was tired and had a bad headache, but she still managed to sew the last stiches in the gown she was making.\n\n5\n00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:49,600\n\"It's the most beautiful dress in the whole world!\" said her daughter, Irene. \"The duchess will love it.\"\n\n6\n00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:00,180\n\"It is nice,\" her mother admitted. \"But, dumpling, it's for tonight's ball, and I don't have the strength to bring it. I feel sick.\"\n\n7\n00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,100\n\"Poor Mama,\" said Irene. \"I can get it there!\"\n\n8\n00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,880\n\"No, cupcake, I can't let you,\" said Mrs. Bobbin.\n\n9\n00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,020\n\"Such a huge package, and it's such a long way to the palace. Besides, it's starting to snow.\"\n\n10\n00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,560\n\"But I love snow,\" Irene insisted.\n\n11\n00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:29,600\nShe coaxed her mother into bed, covered her with two quilts, and added a blanket for her feet.\n\n12\n00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,890\nThen she fixed some tea with lemon and honey and put more wood in the stove.\n\n13\n00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:46,950\nWith great care, Irene took the splendid gown down from the dummy and packed it in a big box with plenty of tissue paper.\n\n14\n00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:56,100\n\"Dress warmly, pudding,\" her mother called in a weak voice, \"and don't forget to button up. It's cold out there, and windy.\"\n\n15\n00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:05,050\nIrene put on her fleece-lined boots, her red hat and muffler, her heavy coat, and her mittens.\n\n16\n00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:13,909\nShe kissed her mother's hot forehead six times, then once again, made sure she was tucked in snugly,\n\n17\n00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:19,640\nand slipped out with the big box, shutting the door firmly behind her.\n\n18\n00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,660\nIt really was cold outside, very cold.\n\n19\n00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:33,419\nThe wind whirled the falling snow-flakes about, this way, that way, and into Irene's squinting face.\n\n20\n00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,800\nShe set out on the uphill path to Farmer Bennett's sheep pasture.\n\n21\n00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:46,100\nBy the time she got there, the snow was up to her ankles and the wind was worse.\n\n22\n00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,209\nIt hurried her along and made her stumble.\n\n23\n00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,940\nIrene resented this; the box was problem enough.\n\n24\n00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,700\n\"Easy does it!\" she cautioned the wind, leaning back hard against it.\n\n25\n00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,799\nBy the middle of the pasture, the flakes were falling thicker.\n\n26\n00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:15,449\nNow the wind drove Irene along so rudely she had to hop, skip, and go helter-skeltering over the knobby ground.\n\n27\n00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:20,580\nCold snow sifted into her boots and chilled her feet.\n\n28\n00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,640\nShe pushed out her lip and hurried on. This was an important errand.\n\n29\n00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,760\nWhen she reached Apple Road, the wind decided to put on a show.\n\n30\n00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,520\nIt ripped branches from trees and flung them about, swept up and scattered the fallen snow,\n\n31\n00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,340\ngot in front of Irene to keep her from moving ahead.\n\n32\n00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,060\nIrene turned around and pressed on backwards.\n\n33\n00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:58,260\n\"Go home!\" the wind squalled. \n\"Irene... go hooome...\"\n\n34\n00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,379\n\"I will do no such thing,\" she snapped. \"No such thing, you wicked wind!\"\n\n35\n00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:14,020\n\"Go ho-o-ome,\" the wind yodeled.\n\"GO HO-WO-WOME,\" it shrieked, \"or else.\"\n\n36\n00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,120\nFor a short second, Irene wondered if she shouldn't heed the wind's warning.\n\n37\n00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,180\nBut no! The gown had to get to the duchess!\n\n38\n00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,060\nThe wind wrestled her for the package-- walloped it, twisted it, shook it, snatched at it.\n\n39\n00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,180\nBut Irene wouldn't yield. \"It's my mother's work!\" she screamed.\n\n40\n00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:45,480\nThen-- oh, woe!-- the box was wrenched from her mittened grasp and sent bumbling along in the snow.\n\n41\n00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,600\nIrene went after it.\n\n42\n00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,760\nShe pounced and took hold, but the ill-tempered wind ripped the box open.\n\n43\n00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,760\nThe ball gown flounced out and went waltzing through the powdered air with tissue-paper attendants.\n\n44\n00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,780\nIrene clung to the empty box and watched the beautiful gown disappear.\n\n45\n00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,599\nHow could anything so terribly wrong be allowed to happen? Tears froze on her lashes.\n\n46\n00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:25,689\nHer dear mother's hard work, all those days of measuring, cutting, pinning, stitching... for this?\n\n47\n00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:34,719\nAnd the poor duchess! Irene decided she would have to trudge on with just the box and explain everything in person.\n\n48\n00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:44,240\nShe went shuffling through the snow. Would her mother understand, she wondered, that it was the wind's fault, not hers?\n\n49\n00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,149\nWould the duchess be angry? The wind was howling like a wild animal.\n\n50\n00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:59,990\nSuddenly Irene stepped in a hole and fell over with a twisted ankle. She blamed it on the wind.\n\n51\n00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:07,220\n\"Keep quiet!\" She scolded. \"You've done enough damage already. You've spoiled everything! Everything!\"\n\n52\n00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,069\nThe wind swallowed up her words.\n\n53\n00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:17,780\nShe sat in the snow in great pain, afraid she wouldn't be able to go on.\n\n54\n00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,079\nBut she managed to get to her feet and start moving. It hurt.\n\n55\n00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:31,990\nHome, where she longed to be, where she and her mother could be warm together, was far behind.\n\n56\n00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:41,639\nIt's got to be closer to the palace, she thought. But where any place was in all this snow, she couldn't be sure.\n\n57\n00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:50,460\nShe plowed on, dragging furrows with her sore foot. The short winter day was almost done.\n\n58\n00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,490\n\"Am I still going the right way?\" she wondered. There was no one around to advise her.\n\n59\n00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:07,780\nWhoever else there was in this snow-covered world was far, far away, and safe indoors-- even the animals in their burrows. She went plodding on.\n\n60\n00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:15,900\nSoon night took over. She knew in the dark that the muffled snow was still falling-- she could feel it.\n\n61\n00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:24,520\nShe was cold and alone in the middle of nowhere. Irene was lost.\n\n62\n00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:32,280\nShe had to keep moving. She was hoping she'd come to a house, any house at all, and be taken in.\n\n63\n00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,800\nShe badly needed to be in someone's arms. The snow was above her knees now.\n\n64\n00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,379\nShe shoved her way through it, clutching the empty box.\n\n65\n00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:52,720\nShe was asking how long a small person could keep this struggle up, when she realized it was getting lighter.\n\n66\n00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,929\nThere was a soft glow coming from somewhere below her.\n\n67\n00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:05,340\nShe waded toward this glow, and soon was gazing down a long slope at a brightly lit mansion.\n\n68\n00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,460\nIt had to be the palace!\n\n69\n00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:18,100\nIrene pushed forward with all her strength and-- sloosh! thwump!-- she plunged downward and was buried.\n\n70\n00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,990\nShe had fallen off a little cliff.\n\n71\n00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,100\nOnly her hat and the box in her hands stuck out above the snow.\n\n72\n00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:35,100\nEven if she could call for help, no one would hear her. Her body shook. Her teeth chattered.\n\n73\n00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:44,120\n\"Why not freeze to death,\" she thought, \"and let all these troubles end.\"\nWhy not? She was already buried.\n\n74\n00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:55,540\nAnd never see her mother's face again? Her good mother who smelled like fresh-baked bread?\n\n75\n00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:05,780\nIn an explosion of fury, she flung her body about to free herself and was finally able to climb up on her knees and look around.\n\n76\n00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:13,170\nHow to get down to that glittering palace? As soon as she raised the question, she had the answer.\n\n77\n00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,380\nShe laid the box down and climbed aboard.\n\n78\n00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,400\nBut it pressed into the snow and stuck.\n\n79\n00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:33,080\nShe tried again, and this time, instead of climbing on, she leaped. The box shot forward, like a sled.\n\n80\n00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:41,220\nThe wind raced after Irene but couldn't keep up. In a moment she would be with people again, inside where it was warm.\n\n81\n00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,960\nThe sled slowed and jerked to a stop on paving stones.\n\n82\n00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,460\nThe time had come to break the bad news to the duchess.\n\n83\n00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:00,160\nWith the empty box clasped to her chest, Irene strode nervously toward the palace.\n\n84\n00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,240\nBut then her feet stopped moving and her mouth fell open. She stared.\n\n85\n00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:16,200\nMaybe this was impossible, yet there it was, a little way off and over to the right, hugging the trunk of a tree--\n\n86\n00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,660\nThe beautiful ball gown! The wind was holding it there.\n\n87\n00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,420\n\"Mama!\" Irene shouted. \"Mama, I found it!\"\n\n88\n00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:37,660\nShe managed somehow, despite the wind's meddling, to get the gown off the tree and back in its box.\n\n89\n00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:46,880\nAnd in another moment she was at the door of the palace. She knocked twice with the big brass knocker.\n\n90\n00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880\nThe door opened and she burst in.\n\n91\n00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,120\nShe was welcomed by cheering servants and a delirious duchess.\n\n92\n00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,420\nThey couldn't believe she had come over the mountain in such a storm, all by herself.\n\n93\n00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,390\nShe had to tell the whole story, every detail. And she did.\n\n94\n00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,620\nThen she asked to be taken right back to her sick mother.\n\n95\n00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:17,970\nBut it was out of the question, they said; the road that ran around the mountain wouldn't be cleared until morning.\n\n96\n00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:27,110\n\"Don't fret, child,\" said the duchess. \"Your mother is surely sleeping now. We'll get you there first thing tomorrow.\"\n\n97\n00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,490\nIrene was given a good dinner as she sat by the fire, the moisture steaming off her clothes.\n\n98\n00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:45,100\nThe duchess, meanwhile, got into her freshly ironed gown before the guests began arriving in their sleighs.\n\n99\n00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:55,620\nWhat a wonderfull ball it was! The duchess in her new gown was like a bright star in the sky.\n\n100\n00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,100\nIrene in her ordinary dress was radiant.\n\n101\n00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:08,780\nShe was swept up into dances by handsome aristocrats, who kept her feet off the floor to spare her ankle.\n\n102\n00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,500\nHer mother would enjoy hearing all about it.\n\n103\n00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:24,740\nEarly the next morning, when snow had long since ceased falling, Mrs. Bobbin woke from a good night's sleep feeling much improved.\n\n104\n00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:34,140\nShe hurried about and got a fire going in the cold stove. Then she went to look in on Irene.\n\n105\n00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,980\nBut Irene's bed was empty! She ran to the window and gazed at the white landscape.\n\n106\n00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,120\nNo one out there. Snow powder fell from the branch of a tree.\n\n107\n00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,060\n\"Where is my child?\" Mrs. Bobbin cried. She whipped on her coat to go out and find her.\n\n108\n00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,460\nWhen she pulled the door open, a wall of drift faced her.\n\n109\n00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:09,000\nBut peering over it, she could see a horse-drawn sleigh hastening up the path.\n\n110\n00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:18,630\nAnd seated on the sleigh, between two large footmen, was Irene herself, asleep but smiling.\n\n111\n00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,940\nWould you like to hear the rest?\n\n112\n00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,940\nWell, there was a bearded doctor in the back of the sleigh...\n\n113\n00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:38,880\nand the duchess had sent Irene's mother a ginger cake with white icing, some oranges and a pineapple, and spice candy of many flavors,\n\n114\n00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:48,000\nalong with a note saying how much she cherished her gown, and what a brave and loving person Irene was.\n\n115\n00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,950\nWhich, of course, Mrs. Bobbin knew. Better than the duchess.\n\n116\n00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,440\nI hope you enjoyed this book, \"Brave Irene.\"",

		"title"		: "The Empty Pot",
		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,020\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:14,440\nI'm Rami Malek, and today I'm going to be reading to you one of my favorite books,\n\n3\n00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,600\nThis is The Empty Pot,\n\n4\n00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,980\nwritten and illustrated by Demi.\n\n5\n00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:30,240\nA long time ago in China there was a boy named Ping who loved flowers.\n\n6\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nAnything he planted burst into bloom. Up came flowers, bushes, and even big fruit trees, as if by magic!\n\n7\n00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:54,720\nEveryone in the kingdom loved flowers too. They planted them everywhere, and the air smelled like perfume.\n\n8\n00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:06,860\nThe Emperor loved birds and animals, but flowers most of all, and he tended his own garden every day.\n\n9\n00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:15,120\nBut the Emperor was very old. He needed to choose a successor to the throne.\n\n10\n00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,380\nWho would his successor be? And how would the Emperor choose?\n\n11\n00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,320\nBecause the Emperor loved flowers so much, he decided to let the flowers choose.\n\n12\n00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,080\nThe next day a proclamation was issued: All the children in the land were to come to the palace.\n\n13\n00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,360\nThere they would be given special flower seeds by the Emperor.\n\n14\n00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,660\n\"Whoever can show me their best in a year's time,\" he said, \"will succeed me to the throne.\"\n\n15\n00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,180\nThis news created great excitement throughout the land!\n\n16\n00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,800\nChildren from all over the country swarmed to the palace to get their flower seeds.\n\n17\n00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:15,140\nAll the parents wanted their children to be chosen Emperor, and all the children hoped they would be chosen too!\n\n18\n00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,680\nWhen Ping received his seed from the Emperor, he was the happiest child of all.\n\n19\n00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,600\nHe was sure he could grow the most beautiful flower.\n\n20\n00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,340\nPing filled a flowerpot with rich soil. He planted the seed in it very carefully.\n\n21\n00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:46,140\nHe watered it every day. He couldn't wait to see it sprout, grow, and blossom into a beautiful flower!\n\n22\n00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,900\nDay after day passed, but nothing grew in his pot.\n\n23\n00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:03,820\nPing was very worried. He put new soil into a bigger pot. Then he transferred the seed into the rich black soil.\n\n24\n00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,400\nAnother two months he waited. Still nothing happened.\n\n25\n00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,800\nBy and by the whole year passed.\n\n26\n00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,300\nSpring came, and all the children put on their best clothes to greet the Emperor.\n\n27\n00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,480\nThey rushed to the palace with their beautiful flowers, eagerly hoping to be chosen.\n\n28\n00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,120\nPing was ashamed of his empty pot.\n\n29\n00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,480\nHe thought the other children would laugh at him because for once he couldn't get a flower to grow.\n\n30\n00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,540\nHis clever friend ran by, holding a great big plant.\n\n31\n00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,780\n\"Ping!\" he said. \"You're not really going to the Emperor with an empty pot, are you?\n\n32\n00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,200\nCouldn't you grow a great big flower like mine?\"\n\n33\n00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:05,420\n\"I've grown lots of flowers better than yours,\" Ping said. \"It's just this seed that won't grow.\"\n\n34\n00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:16,900\nPing's father overheard this and said, \"You did your best, and your best is good enough to present to the Emperor.\"\n\n35\n00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,960\nHolding the empty pot in his hands, Ping went straight away to the palace.\n\n36\n00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,580\nThe Emperor was looking at the flowers slowly, one by one.\n\n37\n00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:41,520\nHow beautiful all the flowers were! But the Emperor was frowning and did not say a word.\n\n38\n00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,780\nFinally he came to Ping.\n\n39\n00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,460\nPing hung his head in shame, expecting to be punished.\n\n40\n00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,920\nThe Emperor asked him, \"Why did you bring an empty pot?\"\n\n41\n00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:12,180\nPing started to cry and replied, \"I planted the seed you gave me and I watered it every day, but it didn't sprout.\n\n42\n00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,620\nI put it in a better pot with better soil, but still it didn't sprout!\n\n43\n00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,940\nI tended it all year long, but nothing grew.\n\n44\n00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:33,280\nSo today I had to bring an empty pot without a flower. It was the best I could do.\n\n45\n00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:45,220\nWhen the Emperor heard these words, a smile slowly spread over his face, and he put his arm around Ping.\n\n46\n00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:57,140\nThen he exclaimed to one and all, \"I have found him! I have found the one person worthy of being Emperor!\n\n47\n00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,480\n\"Where you got your seeds from, I do not know. For the seeds I gave you had all been cooked.\n\n48\n00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,900\nSo it was impossible for any of them to grow.\n\n49\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,640\n\"I admire Ping's great courage to appear before me with the empty truth,\n\n50\n00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:26,940\nand now I reward him with my entire kingdom and make him Emperor of all the land!\"\n\n51\n00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:47,900\nWhat I love about The Empty Pot is it does allow me to look inside and realize just how much truth means.\n\n52\n00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:57,000\nBecause ultimately the only consequences are feeling like you're courageous, and honorable, and a bigger person,\n\n53\n00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,520\nand I guarantee you, the truth always wins.\n\n54\n00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,340\nSo thank you to The Empty Pot for such a strong message. Keep telling the truth.\n\n55\n00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,060\nThank you guys for watching Storyline Online. Make sure to check out all of our stories.\n\n56\n00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,940\nKeep watching and definitely keep reading.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,760\nWelcome to BookPALS Storyline Online brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,740\nMy name is Camryn Manheim. You may know me from \"The Practice,\" but I hope not, because it was on way past your bedtime.\n\n3\n00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:22,900\nToday I am going to read \"Enemy Pie,\" written by Derek Munson and illustrated by Tara Calahan King.\n\n4\n00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,500\nIt should have been a perfect summer.\n\n5\n00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,380\nMy dad helped me build a tree house in our backyard. My sister was at camp for three whole weeks.\n\n6\n00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,110\nAnd I was on the best baseball team in town.\n\n7\n00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,040\nIt should have been a perfect summer. But it wasn't.\n\n8\n00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:50,000\nIt was all good until Jeremy Ross moved into the neighborhood, right next door to my best friend Stanley.\n\n9\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920\nI did not like Jeremy Ross.\n\n10\n00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,060\nHe laughed at me when he struck me out in a baseball game. He had a party on his trampoline, and I wasn't even invited.\n\n11\n00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:09,940\nBut my best friend Stanley was. Jeremy Ross was the one and only person on my enemy list.\n\n12\n00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:17,600\nI never even had an enemy list until he moved into the neighborhood. But as soon as he came along, I needed one.\n\n13\n00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,540\nI hung it up in my tree house, where Jeremy Ross was not allowed to go.\n\n14\n00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,840\nDad understood stuff like enemies. He told me that when he was my age he had enemies too.\n\n15\n00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,840\nBut he knew a good way to get rid of them. I asked him to tell me how.\n\n16\n00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:42,210\n\"Tell you how? I'll show you how!\" he said. He pulled a really old recipe book off the kitchen shelf.\n\n17\n00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,340\nInside, there was a worn-out scrap of paper with faded writing. Dad held it up and squinted at it.\n\n18\n00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,800\n\"Enemy Pie,\" he said, satisfied.\n\n19\n00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,110\nYou may be wondering what exactly is in Enemy Pie. I was wondering, too.\n\n20\n00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,820\nBut Dad said the recipe was so secret, he couldn't even tell me.\n\n21\n00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,739\nI decided it must be magic. I begged him to tell me something– anything.\n\n22\n00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:18,149\n\"I will tell you this,\" he said. \"Enemy Pie is the fastest known way to get rid of enemies.\"\n\n23\n00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:27,069\nNow, of course, this got my mind working. What kinds of things– disgusting things– would I put into a pie for an enemy?\n\n24\n00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,300\nI brought Dad some weeds from the garden, but he just shook his head.\n\n25\n00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,859\nI brought him earthworms and rocks, but he didn't think he needed those.\n\n26\n00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,060\nI gave him the gum I'd been chewing on all morning. He gave it right back to me.\n\n27\n00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,060\nI went out to play alone. I shot baskets until the ball got stuck on the roof.\n\n28\n00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,560\nI threw a boomerang that never came back to me.\n\n29\n00:02:52,569 --> 00:03:02,019\nAnd all the while, I listened to the sounds of my dad chopping and stirring and blending the ingredients of Enemy Pie.\n\n30\n00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,939\nThis could be a great summer after all.\n\n31\n00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,860\nEnemy Pie was going to be awful.\n\n32\n00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,069\nI tried to imagine how horrible it must smell, or worse yet, what it was going to look like.\n\n33\n00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:23,700\nBut when I was in the backyard, looking for ladybugs, I smelled something really, really, really good,\n\n34\n00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,120\nand as far as I could tell, it was coming from our kitchen. I was a bit confused.\n\n35\n00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,340\nI went in to ask my Dad what was wrong, Enemy Pie shouldn't smell this good. But Dad was smart.\n\n36\n00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,360\n\"If Enemy Pie smelled bad, your enemy would never eat it,\" he said. I could tell he'd made Enemy Pie before.\n\n37\n00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,060\nThe buzzer rang, and Dad put on the oven mitts and pulled the pie out of the oven.\n\n38\n00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,500\nIt looked like plain old pie. It looked good enough to eat!\n\n39\n00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,979\nI was catching on.\n\n40\n00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,180\nBut still, I wasn't really sure how this Enemy Pie worked. What exactly did it do to enemies?\n\n41\n00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,760\nMaybe it made their hair fall out, or their breath stinky. Maybe it made bullies cry.\n\n42\n00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,999\nI asked Dad, but he was no help.  He wouldn't tell me a thing.\n\n43\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,820\nBut while the pie cooled, he filled me in on my job.\n\n44\n00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:26,300\nHe talked quietly. \"There is one part of Enemy Pie that I can't do. In order for it to work, you need to spend a day with your enemy.\n\n45\n00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,480\nEven worse, you have to be nice to him. It's not easy.\n\n46\n00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,440\nBut that's the only way that Enemy Pie can work. Are you sure you want to go through with this?\"\n\n47\n00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,700\nOf course I was. It sounded horrible. It was scary. But it was worth a try.\n\n48\n00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,199\nAll I had to do was spend one day with Jeremy Ross, then he'd be out of my hair for the rest of my life.\n\n49\n00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,289\nI rode my bike to his house and knocked on the door.\n\n50\n00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,040\nWhen Jeremy opened the door, he seemed surprised.\n\n51\n00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,960\nHe stood on the other side of the screen door and looked at me, waiting for me to say something.\n\n52\n00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,020\nI was nervous. \"Can you play?\" I asked. He looked confused.\n\n53\n00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:16,099\n\"I'll go ask my mom,\" he said. He came back with his shoes in his hand. His mom walked around the corner to say hello.\n\n54\n00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,360\n\"You boys stay out of trouble,\" she said, smiling.\n\n55\n00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,680\nWe rode bikes for a while and played on the trampoline.\n\n56\n00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,120\nThen we made some water balloons and threw them at the neighborhood girls, but we missed.\n\n57\n00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,620\nJeremy's mom made us lunch. After lunch we went over to my house.\n\n58\n00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,689\nIt was strange, but I was kind of having fun with my enemy. He almost seemed nice.\n\n59\n00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:46,620\nBut of course I couldn't tell Dad that, since he had worked so hard to make the Enemy Pie.\n\n60\n00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,420\nJeremy Ross liked my basketball hoop. He said he wished he had a basketball hoop, but they didn't have room for one.\n\n61\n00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880\nI let him win a game, just to be nice.\n\n62\n00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,500\nJeremy Ross knew how to throw a boomerang. He threw it and it came right back to him.\n\n63\n00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,280\nI threw it and it went over my house and into the backyard.\n\n64\n00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:16,629\nWhen we climbed over the fence to find it, the first thing Jeremy noticed was my tree house.\n\n65\n00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,620\nMy tree house was my tree house. I was the boss.\n\n66\n00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,520\nIf my sister wanted in, I didn't have to let her. If my dad wanted in, I didn't have to let him.\n\n67\n00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,900\nAnd Jeremy Ross wanted in.\n\n68\n00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,160\n\"Can we go in it?\" he asked.\n\n69\n00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,040\nI knew he was going to ask me that! But he was the top person, the ONLY person, on my enemy list.\n\n70\n00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,680\nAnd enemies aren't allowed in my tree house.\n\n71\n00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,180\nBut he did teach me to throw a boomerang. And he did have me over for lunch. And he did let me play on his trampoline.\n\n72\n00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,349\nHe wasn't being a very good enemy.\n\n73\n00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:01,529\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"but hold on.\" \nI climbed up ahead of him and tore the enemy list off the wall.\n\n74\n00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:07,739\nI had a checkerboard and some cards in the tree house, and we played games until my dad called us down for dinner.\n\n75\n00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:12,550\nWe pretended we didn't hear him, and when he came out to get us, we tried to hide from him.\n\n76\n00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,940\nBut somehow he found us.\n\n77\n00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,360\nDad made us macaroni and cheese for dinner– my favorite. It was Jeremy's favorite, too!\n\n78\n00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,800\nMaybe Jeremy Ross wasn't so bad after all.\n\n79\n00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,720\nI was beginning to think that maybe we should just forget about Enemy Pie.\n\n80\n00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,200\nBut sure enough, after dinner, Dad brought out the pie. I watched as he cut the pie into eight thick slices.\n\n81\n00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,279\n\"Dad,\" I said, \"It sure is nice having a new friend in the neighborhood.\"\n\n82\n00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:50,509\nI was trying to get his attention and trying to tell him that Jeremy Ross was no longer my enemy. But Dad only smiled and nodded.\n\n83\n00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,880\nI think he thought I was just pretending.\n\n84\n00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,540\nDad dished up three plates, side by side, with big pieces of pie and giant scoops of ice cream.\n\n85\n00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,120\nHe passed one to me and one to Jeremy.\n\n86\n00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,500\n\"Wow!\" Jeremy said, looking at the pie, \"my dad never makes pies like this.\"\n\n87\n00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:15,340\nIt was at this point that I panicked. I didn't want Jeremy to eat Enemy Pie!\n\n88\n00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,780\nHe was my friend! I couldn't let him eat it!\n\n89\n00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,220\n\"Jeremy, don't eat it! It's bad pie! I think it's poisonous or something!\"\n\n90\n00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,300\nJeremy's fork stopped before reaching his mouth. He crumpled his eyebrows and looked at me funny.\n\n91\n00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,880\nI felt relieved. I had saved his life. I was a hero.\n\n92\n00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,320\n\"If it's so bad,\" Jeremy asked, \"then why has your dad already eaten half of it?\"\n\n93\n00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,940\nI turned to look at my dad. Sure enough, he was eating Enemy Pie!\n\n94\n00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,580\n\"Good stuff,\" he mumbled through a mouthful. And that was all he said.\n\n95\n00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,840\nI sat there watching them eat Enemy Pie for a few seconds.\n\n96\n00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,880\nDad was laughing. Jeremy was happily eating. And neither of them was losing any hair!\n\n97\n00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,660\nIt seemed safe enough, so I took a tiny taste.\n\n98\n00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,160\nEnemy Pie was delicious!\n\n99\n00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,200\nAfter dessert, Jeremy rode his bike home but not before inviting me over to play on his trampoline in the morning.\n\n100\n00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,800\nHe said he'd teach me how to flip.\n\n101\n00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,560\nAs for Enemy Pie, I still don't know how to make it.\n\n102\n00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,340\nI still wonder if enemies really do hate it or if their hair falls out or their breath turns bad.\n\n103\n00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:41,120\nBut I don't know if I'll ever get an answer, because I just lost my best enemy.",
