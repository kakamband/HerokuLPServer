Have a nice day!\"\nArnie heard the baker say to the man.\n\n41\n00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,540\n\"Mr. Bing... that's a fine name,\" Arnie decided. \"I can hardly wait to meet him!\"\n\n42\n00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,180\n\"Good-bye Arnie!\"\n\"We'll miss you!\"\n\n43\n00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,120\n\"I should have talked to him while I had the chance.\"\n\n44\n00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,800\nThe ride to Mr. Bing's apartment was a little bumpy.\n\n45\n00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,700\nArnie was grateful for the soft napkin the baker had so thoughtfully placed underneath him in the bag.\n\n46\n00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,420\nHe had never ridden in a car and wished he could look out the window to see all the sights.\n\n47\n00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,340\nBut more than anything, he wished he could meet Mr. Bing.\n\n48\n00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,160\n\"Why does he keep me in this bag?\" Arnie wondered.\n\n49\n00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,280\nFinally, the car came to a stop and they were home.\n\n50\n00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,200\nMr. Bing carefully removed Arnie from his paper bag and placed him on a clean, shiny plate.\n\n51\n00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,100\n\"What a handsome plate,\" Arnie said to himself.\n\n52\n00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,700\n\"I'm not crazy about the design-- I prefer a more modern look. But it's nothing a little paint can't fix.\"\n\n53\n00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,440\nMr. Bing gently lifted Arnie from his new plate.\n\n54\n00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,520\n\"Isn't that cute?\" thought Arnie, as he closed his eyes and smiled. \"He wants to hold me.\"\n\n55\n00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,760\nAs Arnie relaxed in Mr. Bing's hand, he felt himself moving higher and higher away from his plate.\n\n56\n00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:06,920\nWhen he opened his eyes to see where he was going, he discovered that he was headed straight for Mr. Bing's open mouth!\n\n57\n00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,520\n\"What are you doing?\" shouted Arnie.\n\n58\n00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,300\nMr. Bing was stunned. He dropped Arnie back onto the plate.\n\n59\n00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,520\n\"I was going to... eat you,\" he replied in shock.\n\n60\n00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,440\n\"Eat me?\" Arnie shrieked, his sprinkles flying everywhere.\n\n61\n00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,340\n\"Why would you do a thing like that? Do you make a habit of eating all your houseguests?\"\n\n62\n00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,460\n\"No... of course not.\"\n\n63\n00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,040\n\"So, why then did it suddenly occur to you to eat me?\" Arnie demanded.\n\n64\n00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,640\n\"Well... because... you're a doughnut.\n\n65\n00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,140\nThat's what doughnuts are for-- to eat.\"\n\n66\n00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,440\n\"Do you mean to tell me you've done this before?\"\n\n67\n00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,320\n\"Yes... I eat a doughnut every day,\" Mr. Bing said sheepishly.\n\n68\n00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,820\nArnie froze. He felt sick and frightened\n\n69\n00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,540\n\"I'd better get out of here before he tries to eat me again!\"\n\n70\n00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,620\nand angry!\n\n71\n00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,700\n\"My friends have probably all been eaten!\"\n\n72\n00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,280\nHe thought to himself for a moment.\n\n73\n00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,920\n\"I must put a stop to this right away! I'll call the bakery and warn the others. Whoever's left, that is!\"\n\n74\n00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,740\nArnie knew that there was no time to waste and that he needed to be very sneaky in order to keep his plan from Mr. Bing.\n\n75\n00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,760\nHe turned to Mr. Bing and said in his sweetest voice,\n\n76\n00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:37,380\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I don't believe we've been properly introduced. My name is Arnie.\"\n\n77\n00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,980\n\"Um... hello... Arnie,\" Mr. Bing stammered.\n\n78\n00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,440\n\"I'm Mr. Bing.

Do you remember me?\n\n84\n00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,280\nYou made me at 5:15 this morning, and I was bought about twenty minutes ago\n\n85\n00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520\nby a man who goes by the name of Mr. Bing.\"\n\n86\n00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,880\n\"Yes, Arnie,\" the baker answered. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n87\n00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,940\n\"Now, I don't want to alarm you, but just moments ago, that man tried to eat me!\n\n88\n00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,760\nAnd not only that-- he claims to have eaten hundreds of us!\n\n89\n00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,760\nI'm going to make a run for it, but I wanted to warn you so that if you see him coming into the bakery again, you can stop him!\"\n\n90\n00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,920\n\"Oh my, Arnie-- I thought you understood. That's why I make doughnuts... for people to eat.\"\n\n91\n00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:02,300\n\"I can't believe it!\" Arnie gasped. \"Are the other doughnuts aware of this arrangement?\"\n\n92\n00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,320\n\"Well, I think so,\" the baker said. \"Let me ask them to make sure.\"\n\n93\n00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,120\nThe baker yelled to the other doughnuts, \"Do you doughnuts know that you're going to be eaten?\"\n\n94\n00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,000\n\"Yes, we know!\" the doughnuts shouted back.\n\"We're delicious! I don't blame them.\"\n\n95\n00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,160\n\"Did you hear that, Arnie?\" the baker asked.\n\n96\n00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,500\nArnie was crushed. The phone dropped from his hand.\n\n97\n00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,980\nHe'd heard all he needed to hear.\n\n98\n00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,420\nArnie forgot all about his plan to escape.\n\n99\n00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,480\nHe collapsed back onto the plate, glanced up at Mr. Bing, and muttered,\n\n100\n00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,760\n\"All right then, let's get this over with. Go ahead and eat me.\"\n\n101\n00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:54,240\nMr. Bing gazed down at Arnie. \"I'm not going to eat you, Arnie,\" he said reassuringly.\n\n102\n00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,000\n\"I just wouldn't feel right about it now.\"\n\n103\n00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,860\n\"Really?\" Arnie said, with a huge sigh of relief.\n\n104\n00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,620\n\"Well, I'm glad to see that you've come to your senses!\"\n\n105\n00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,840\n\"But since I'm not going to eat you,\" Mr. Bing continued, \"I'll have to figure out something else to do with you.\n\n106\n00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,900\nI paid good money for you-- I don't want to be wasteful.\"\n\n107\n00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,140\n\"Of course not!\" Arnie agreed.\n\n108\n00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,520\n\"What we need to do is each make a list of things I can do with you instead of eating you.\n\n109\n00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,480\nBetween the two of us, I know we'll come up with something.\"\n\n110\n00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:36,040\n\"Good plan, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie said. \"This will be a breeze-- I bet I'm good at lots of stuff!\"\n\n111\n00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,140\nThey both feverishly wrote down their ideas.\n\n112\n00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,940\nWhen they were finished, Mr. Bing asked, \"Would you like to read yours first?\"\n\n113\n00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,720\n\"Sure thing, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie answered.\n\n114\n00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320\nThings Mr. Bing can Do with Me Instead of Eating Me\n\n115\n00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,600\n\"Do you need a ballroom dance partner?\"\n\n116\n00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,240\n\"No, I don't dance.\"\n\n117\n00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300\n\"You could use a personal fitness trainer.\"\n\n118\n00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,580\n\"Hmm, I'd get too sweaty.\"\n\n119\n00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,120\n\"How about a portrait painter?\"\n\n120\n00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,560\n\"Oh, heavens no!\"\n\n121\n00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,440\n\"Would you like me to entertain you at parties?\"\n\n122\n00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,980\n\"Doughnut make my brown eyes bluuue...\"\n\n123\n00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,080\n\"I don't like throwing parties.\"\n\n124\n00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,620\n\"I could be your chauffeur.\"\n\n125\n00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,920\n\"But you can't see over the steering wheel.\"\n\n126\n00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680\n\"I'd make a great bodyguard!\"\n\n127\n00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,160\n\"Who could you protect me from-- a cookie?\"\n\n128\n00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,940\n\"All righty, Mr. Bing.

They felt terribly disappointed.\n\n145\n00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,620\nAfter a few minutes of awkward silence, Mr. Bing finally spoke.\n\n146\n00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,320\n\"I'm sorry, Arnie-- but it's clear that we can't agree on anything for you to do around here.\n\n147\n00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,800\nThis is difficult for me to say, but I think it would be best if you found another home.\"\n\n148\n00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,460\n\"I know,\" said Arnie, fighting back tears. \"I'll just be on my way then.\n\n149\n00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,660\nIs it all right if I keep this napkin to pack up all my loose sprinkles?\"\n\n150\n00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,420\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Bing replied sadly.\n\n151\n00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,560\n\"As soon as I get a job, I'll pay you back the money you spent on me.\"\n\n152\n00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800\n\"That's not necessary, Arnie.\"\n\n153\n00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,680\nArnie shook Mr. Bing's hand and thanked him for his kindness.\n\n154\n00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,980\nMr. Bing opened the door, and as Arnie left he paused and said,\n\n155\n00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,600\n\"I guess doughnuts really are only good for eating, aren't they?\"\n\n156\n00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,120\nThey both waved good-bye and Arnie was gone.\n\n157\n00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360\nMr. Bing stood at the window and watched as Arnie walked away.\n\n158\n00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,940\nHe walked past the flower beds, the mailboxes, and the apartment manager's office.\n\n159\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,100\n\"Is there anything worse than a sad pastry?\"\n\n160\n00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:35,100\nHe passed the tennis court, the swimming pool, and the clubhouse.\n\n161\n00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,200\n--\"Oh my gosh, is that a doughnut?\"\n\n162\n00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:48,040\nBut when Arnie reached the \"No Dogs Allowed\" sign at the end of the driveway, Mr. Bing suddenly came up with a new idea.\n\n163\n00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,380\n\"Arnie! Wait up! Arnie!\" yelled Mr. Bing as he ran after him.\n\n164\n00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,480\nArnie turned back and stopped. When Mr. Bing caught up with him, he was out of breath.\n\n165\n00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,520\n\"I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier!\" Mr. Bing panted.\n\n166\n00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,800\n\"Arnie, I've always wanted a dog--\n\n167\n00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,140\n\"Keep talkin', big guy.\"\n\n168\n00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,020\n\"--and could never have one because they're not allowed here.\n\n169\n00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,100\nBut there's no sign that says \"No Doughnuts Allowed.\"\n\n170\n00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,240\nArnie perked up when he realized what Mr. Bing was thinking.\n\n171\n00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,000\n\"Would you like to take walks and play fetch?\" Mr. Bing asked excitedly.\n\n172\n00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,760\n\"You bet I would!\"\n\n173\n00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,760\n\"Can you do tricks, like rolling over?\"\n\n174\n00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,180\n\"Rolling over? Look at me-- I was made for rolling over!\"\n\n175\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,480\n\"Well, then, there's only one thing left to ask. Arnie, will you be my doughnut-dog?\"\n\n176\n00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,180\n\"Oh, Mr. Bing-- I would love to be your doughnut-dog!\"\n\n177\n00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,280\nFrom that moment on, Arnie and Mr. Bing were inseparable.\n\n178\n00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,200\nArnie liked being a doughnut-dog even better than he liked being a doughnut!\n\n179\n00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,200\n\"Arf! Arf! Arf!\"\n\n180\n00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,740\nHe went through a short phase of chewing on furniture and barking at the mailmain,\n\n181\n00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,360\nbut after a crash course in obedience school, he graduated first in his class.\n\n182\n00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:13,420\nEverywhere the two of them went, people would stop to pet Arnie. No one had ever seen a doughnut-dog before.\n\n183\n00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,180\n--\"Oh, what a darling man.\"\n--\"What a darling dog!\"\n\n184\n00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,940\nArnie and Mr. Bing had so much fun together.\n\n185\n00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,980\nArnie was the best pet Mr. Bing could ever have hoped for-- and Mr. Bing was Arnie's best friend.\n\n186\n00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,740\nThe end.\n\n187\n00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:41,120\nI chose this book because it illustrates that two people who come from very different backgrounds,\n\n188\n00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,620\nthe eater and the eat-ee--\n\n189\n00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,840\n-- can come together and compromise.\n\n190\n00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,280\nAnd decide that together, eating doesn't need to take place at all, they can just be friends.\n\n191\n00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,420\nSometimes, you're the eater. Sometimes, you're the eaten.\n\n192\n00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,620\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n193\n00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,680\nHope you enjoyed it.\n\n194\n00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,940\nPlease feel free to check out some of our other terrific stories.\n\n195\n00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,900\nKeep reading, keep watching, keep eating.",
