Have a nice day!\"\nArnie heard the baker say to the man.\n\n41\n00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,540\n\"Mr. Bing... that's a fine name,\" Arnie decided. \"I can hardly wait to meet him!\"\n\n42\n00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,180\n\"Good-bye Arnie!\"\n\"We'll miss you!\"\n\n43\n00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,120\n\"I should have talked to him while I had the chance.\"\n\n44\n00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:00,800\nThe ride to Mr. Bing's apartment was a little bumpy.\n\n45\n00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:07,700\nArnie was grateful for the soft napkin the baker had so thoughtfully placed underneath him in the bag.\n\n46\n00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,420\nHe had never ridden in a car and wished he could look out the window to see all the sights.\n\n47\n00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,340\nBut more than anything, he wished he could meet Mr. Bing.\n\n48\n00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,160\n\"Why does he keep me in this bag?\" Arnie wondered.\n\n49\n00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,280\nFinally, the car came to a stop and they were home.\n\n50\n00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,200\nMr. Bing carefully removed Arnie from his paper bag and placed him on a clean, shiny plate.\n\n51\n00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,100\n\"What a handsome plate,\" Arnie said to himself.\n\n52\n00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:41,700\n\"I'm not crazy about the design-- I prefer a more modern look. But it's nothing a little paint can't fix.\"\n\n53\n00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,440\nMr. Bing gently lifted Arnie from his new plate.\n\n54\n00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:52,520\n\"Isn't that cute?\" thought Arnie, as he closed his eyes and smiled. \"He wants to hold me.\"\n\n55\n00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,760\nAs Arnie relaxed in Mr. Bing's hand, he felt himself moving higher and higher away from his plate.\n\n56\n00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:06,920\nWhen he opened his eyes to see where he was going, he discovered that he was headed straight for Mr. Bing's open mouth!\n\n57\n00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,520\n\"What are you doing?\" shouted Arnie.\n\n58\n00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,300\nMr. Bing was stunned. He dropped Arnie back onto the plate.\n\n59\n00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,520\n\"I was going to... eat you,\" he replied in shock.\n\n60\n00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:26,440\n\"Eat me?\" Arnie shrieked, his sprinkles flying everywhere.\n\n61\n00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,340\n\"Why would you do a thing like that? Do you make a habit of eating all your houseguests?\"\n\n62\n00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,460\n\"No... of course not.\"\n\n63\n00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,040\n\"So, why then did it suddenly occur to you to eat me?\" Arnie demanded.\n\n64\n00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,640\n\"Well... because... you're a doughnut.\n\n65\n00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,140\nThat's what doughnuts are for-- to eat.\"\n\n66\n00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,440\n\"Do you mean to tell me you've done this before?\"\n\n67\n00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,320\n\"Yes... I eat a doughnut every day,\" Mr. Bing said sheepishly.\n\n68\n00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,820\nArnie froze. He felt sick and frightened\n\n69\n00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,540\n\"I'd better get out of here before he tries to eat me again!\"\n\n70\n00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,620\nand angry!\n\n71\n00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,700\n\"My friends have probably all been eaten!\"\n\n72\n00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,280\nHe thought to himself for a moment.\n\n73\n00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,920\n\"I must put a stop to this right away! I'll call the bakery and warn the others. Whoever's left, that is!\"\n\n74\n00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:24,740\nArnie knew that there was no time to waste and that he needed to be very sneaky in order to keep his plan from Mr. Bing.\n\n75\n00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,760\nHe turned to Mr. Bing and said in his sweetest voice,\n\n76\n00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:37,380\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I don't believe we've been properly introduced. My name is Arnie.\"\n\n77\n00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,980\n\"Um... hello... Arnie,\" Mr. Bing stammered.\n\n78\n00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,440\n\"I'm Mr. Bing.

Do you remember me?\n\n84\n00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,280\nYou made me at 5:15 this morning, and I was bought about twenty minutes ago\n\n85\n00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,520\nby a man who goes by the name of Mr. Bing.\"\n\n86\n00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,880\n\"Yes, Arnie,\" the baker answered. \"What can I do for you?\"\n\n87\n00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,940\n\"Now, I don't want to alarm you, but just moments ago, that man tried to eat me!\n\n88\n00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,760\nAnd not only that-- he claims to have eaten hundreds of us!\n\n89\n00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,760\nI'm going to make a run for it, but I wanted to warn you so that if you see him coming into the bakery again, you can stop him!\"\n\n90\n00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:54,920\n\"Oh my, Arnie-- I thought you understood. That's why I make doughnuts... for people to eat.\"\n\n91\n00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:02,300\n\"I can't believe it!\" Arnie gasped. \"Are the other doughnuts aware of this arrangement?\"\n\n92\n00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:07,320\n\"Well, I think so,\" the baker said. \"Let me ask them to make sure.\"\n\n93\n00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:13,120\nThe baker yelled to the other doughnuts, \"Do you doughnuts know that you're going to be eaten?\"\n\n94\n00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:19,000\n\"Yes, we know!\" the doughnuts shouted back.\n\"We're delicious! I don't blame them.\"\n\n95\n00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,160\n\"Did you hear that, Arnie?\" the baker asked.\n\n96\n00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,500\nArnie was crushed. The phone dropped from his hand.\n\n97\n00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,980\nHe'd heard all he needed to hear.\n\n98\n00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,420\nArnie forgot all about his plan to escape.\n\n99\n00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,480\nHe collapsed back onto the plate, glanced up at Mr. Bing, and muttered,\n\n100\n00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:45,760\n\"All right then, let's get this over with. Go ahead and eat me.\"\n\n101\n00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:54,240\nMr. Bing gazed down at Arnie. \"I'm not going to eat you, Arnie,\" he said reassuringly.\n\n102\n00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,000\n\"I just wouldn't feel right about it now.\"\n\n103\n00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,860\n\"Really?\" Arnie said, with a huge sigh of relief.\n\n104\n00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,620\n\"Well, I'm glad to see that you've come to your senses!\"\n\n105\n00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:11,840\n\"But since I'm not going to eat you,\" Mr. Bing continued, \"I'll have to figure out something else to do with you.\n\n106\n00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,900\nI paid good money for you-- I don't want to be wasteful.\"\n\n107\n00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,140\n\"Of course not!\" Arnie agreed.\n\n108\n00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:24,520\n\"What we need to do is each make a list of things I can do with you instead of eating you.\n\n109\n00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,480\nBetween the two of us, I know we'll come up with something.\"\n\n110\n00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:36,040\n\"Good plan, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie said. \"This will be a breeze-- I bet I'm good at lots of stuff!\"\n\n111\n00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,140\nThey both feverishly wrote down their ideas.\n\n112\n00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,940\nWhen they were finished, Mr. Bing asked, \"Would you like to read yours first?\"\n\n113\n00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,720\n\"Sure thing, Mr. Bing!\" Arnie answered.\n\n114\n00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,320\nThings Mr. Bing can Do with Me Instead of Eating Me\n\n115\n00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,600\n\"Do you need a ballroom dance partner?\"\n\n116\n00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,240\n\"No, I don't dance.\"\n\n117\n00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,300\n\"You could use a personal fitness trainer.\"\n\n118\n00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,580\n\"Hmm, I'd get too sweaty.\"\n\n119\n00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,120\n\"How about a portrait painter?\"\n\n120\n00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,560\n\"Oh, heavens no!\"\n\n121\n00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,440\n\"Would you like me to entertain you at parties?\"\n\n122\n00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:13,980\n\"Doughnut make my brown eyes bluuue...\"\n\n123\n00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,080\n\"I don't like throwing parties.\"\n\n124\n00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,620\n\"I could be your chauffeur.\"\n\n125\n00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:22,920\n\"But you can't see over the steering wheel.\"\n\n126\n00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680\n\"I'd make a great bodyguard!\"\n\n127\n00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,160\n\"Who could you protect me from-- a cookie?\"\n\n128\n00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,940\n\"All righty, Mr. Bing.

They felt terribly disappointed.\n\n145\n00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,620\nAfter a few minutes of awkward silence, Mr. Bing finally spoke.\n\n146\n00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,320\n\"I'm sorry, Arnie-- but it's clear that we can't agree on anything for you to do around here.\n\n147\n00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,800\nThis is difficult for me to say, but I think it would be best if you found another home.\"\n\n148\n00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:37,460\n\"I know,\" said Arnie, fighting back tears. \"I'll just be on my way then.\n\n149\n00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,660\nIs it all right if I keep this napkin to pack up all my loose sprinkles?\"\n\n150\n00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,420\n\"Of course,\" Mr. Bing replied sadly.\n\n151\n00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,560\n\"As soon as I get a job, I'll pay you back the money you spent on me.\"\n\n152\n00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800\n\"That's not necessary, Arnie.\"\n\n153\n00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,680\nArnie shook Mr. Bing's hand and thanked him for his kindness.\n\n154\n00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,980\nMr. Bing opened the door, and as Arnie left he paused and said,\n\n155\n00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:07,600\n\"I guess doughnuts really are only good for eating, aren't they?\"\n\n156\n00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,120\nThey both waved good-bye and Arnie was gone.\n\n157\n00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360\nMr. Bing stood at the window and watched as Arnie walked away.\n\n158\n00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:22,940\nHe walked past the flower beds, the mailboxes, and the apartment manager's office.\n\n159\n00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,100\n\"Is there anything worse than a sad pastry?\"\n\n160\n00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:35,100\nHe passed the tennis court, the swimming pool, and the clubhouse.\n\n161\n00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,200\n--\"Oh my gosh, is that a doughnut?\"\n\n162\n00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:48,040\nBut when Arnie reached the \"No Dogs Allowed\" sign at the end of the driveway, Mr. Bing suddenly came up with a new idea.\n\n163\n00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,380\n\"Arnie! Wait up! Arnie!\" yelled Mr. Bing as he ran after him.\n\n164\n00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,480\nArnie turned back and stopped. When Mr. Bing caught up with him, he was out of breath.\n\n165\n00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,520\n\"I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier!\" Mr. Bing panted.\n\n166\n00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,800\n\"Arnie, I've always wanted a dog--\n\n167\n00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,140\n\"Keep talkin', big guy.\"\n\n168\n00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:10,020\n\"--and could never have one because they're not allowed here.\n\n169\n00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,100\nBut there's no sign that says \"No Doughnuts Allowed.\"\n\n170\n00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,240\nArnie perked up when he realized what Mr. Bing was thinking.\n\n171\n00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,000\n\"Would you like to take walks and play fetch?\" Mr. Bing asked excitedly.\n\n172\n00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,760\n\"You bet I would!\"\n\n173\n00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,760\n\"Can you do tricks, like rolling over?\"\n\n174\n00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,180\n\"Rolling over? Look at me-- I was made for rolling over!\"\n\n175\n00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:39,480\n\"Well, then, there's only one thing left to ask. Arnie, will you be my doughnut-dog?\"\n\n176\n00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,180\n\"Oh, Mr. Bing-- I would love to be your doughnut-dog!\"\n\n177\n00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:49,280\nFrom that moment on, Arnie and Mr. Bing were inseparable.\n\n178\n00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:53,200\nArnie liked being a doughnut-dog even better than he liked being a doughnut!\n\n179\n00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,200\n\"Arf! Arf! Arf!\"\n\n180\n00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,740\nHe went through a short phase of chewing on furniture and barking at the mailmain,\n\n181\n00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,360\nbut after a crash course in obedience school, he graduated first in his class.\n\n182\n00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:13,420\nEverywhere the two of them went, people would stop to pet Arnie. No one had ever seen a doughnut-dog before.\n\n183\n00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,180\n--\"Oh, what a darling man.\"\n--\"What a darling dog!\"\n\n184\n00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,940\nArnie and Mr. Bing had so much fun together.\n\n185\n00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:28,980\nArnie was the best pet Mr. Bing could ever have hoped for-- and Mr. Bing was Arnie's best friend.\n\n186\n00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,740\nThe end.\n\n187\n00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:41,120\nI chose this book because it illustrates that two people who come from very different backgrounds,\n\n188\n00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,620\nthe eater and the eat-ee--\n\n189\n00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,840\n-- can come together and compromise.\n\n190\n00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,280\nAnd decide that together, eating doesn't need to take place at all, they can just be friends.\n\n191\n00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:58,420\nSometimes, you're the eater. Sometimes, you're the eaten.\n\n192\n00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,620\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n193\n00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,680\nHope you enjoyed it.\n\n194\n00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,940\nPlease feel free to check out some of our other terrific stories.\n\n195\n00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,900\nKeep reading, keep watching, keep eating.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:12,900\nHi, I'm Al Gore and this is part of the BookPALS program, sponsored by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:24,460\nAnd today, I'm going to read you this book, written and illustrated by William Steig, it's called \"Brave Irene.\"\n\n3\n00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,340\nHere's how it begins...\n\n4\n00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:40,820\nMrs. Bobbin, the dressmaker, was tired and had a bad headache, but she still managed to sew the last stiches in the gown she was making.\n\n5\n00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:49,600\n\"It's the most beautiful dress in the whole world!\" said her daughter, Irene. \"The duchess will love it.\"\n\n6\n00:00:49,600 --> 00:01:00,180\n\"It is nice,\" her mother admitted. \"But, dumpling, it's for tonight's ball, and I don't have the strength to bring it. I feel sick.\"\n\n7\n00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,100\n\"Poor Mama,\" said Irene. \"I can get it there!\"\n\n8\n00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:09,880\n\"No, cupcake, I can't let you,\" said Mrs. Bobbin.\n\n9\n00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,020\n\"Such a huge package, and it's such a long way to the palace. Besides, it's starting to snow.\"\n\n10\n00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,560\n\"But I love snow,\" Irene insisted.\n\n11\n00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:29,600\nShe coaxed her mother into bed, covered her with two quilts, and added a blanket for her feet.\n\n12\n00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,890\nThen she fixed some tea with lemon and honey and put more wood in the stove.\n\n13\n00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:46,950\nWith great care, Irene took the splendid gown down from the dummy and packed it in a big box with plenty of tissue paper.\n\n14\n00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:56,100\n\"Dress warmly, pudding,\" her mother called in a weak voice, \"and don't forget to button up. It's cold out there, and windy.\"\n\n15\n00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:05,050\nIrene put on her fleece-lined boots, her red hat and muffler, her heavy coat, and her mittens.\n\n16\n00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:13,909\nShe kissed her mother's hot forehead six times, then once again, made sure she was tucked in snugly,\n\n17\n00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:19,640\nand slipped out with the big box, shutting the door firmly behind her.\n\n18\n00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,660\nIt really was cold outside, very cold.\n\n19\n00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:33,419\nThe wind whirled the falling snow-flakes about, this way, that way, and into Irene's squinting face.\n\n20\n00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,800\nShe set out on the uphill path to Farmer Bennett's sheep pasture.\n\n21\n00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:46,100\nBy the time she got there, the snow was up to her ankles and the wind was worse.\n\n22\n00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,209\nIt hurried her along and made her stumble.\n\n23\n00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,940\nIrene resented this; the box was problem enough.\n\n24\n00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,700\n\"Easy does it!\" she cautioned the wind, leaning back hard against it.\n\n25\n00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,799\nBy the middle of the pasture, the flakes were falling thicker.\n\n26\n00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:15,449\nNow the wind drove Irene along so rudely she had to hop, skip, and go helter-skeltering over the knobby ground.\n\n27\n00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:20,580\nCold snow sifted into her boots and chilled her feet.\n\n28\n00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,640\nShe pushed out her lip and hurried on. This was an important errand.\n\n29\n00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,760\nWhen she reached Apple Road, the wind decided to put on a show.\n\n30\n00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:39,520\nIt ripped branches from trees and flung them about, swept up and scattered the fallen snow,\n\n31\n00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,340\ngot in front of Irene to keep her from moving ahead.\n\n32\n00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,060\nIrene turned around and pressed on backwards.\n\n33\n00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:58,260\n\"Go home!\" the wind squalled. \n\"Irene... go hooome...\"\n\n34\n00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:03,379\n\"I will do no such thing,\" she snapped. \"No such thing, you wicked wind!\"\n\n35\n00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:14,020\n\"Go ho-o-ome,\" the wind yodeled.\n\"GO HO-WO-WOME,\" it shrieked, \"or else.\"\n\n36\n00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:20,120\nFor a short second, Irene wondered if she shouldn't heed the wind's warning.\n\n37\n00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,180\nBut no! The gown had to get to the duchess!\n\n38\n00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:32,060\nThe wind wrestled her for the package-- walloped it, twisted it, shook it, snatched at it.\n\n39\n00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,180\nBut Irene wouldn't yield. \"It's my mother's work!\" she screamed.\n\n40\n00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:45,480\nThen-- oh, woe!-- the box was wrenched from her mittened grasp and sent bumbling along in the snow.\n\n41\n00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,600\nIrene went after it.\n\n42\n00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,760\nShe pounced and took hold, but the ill-tempered wind ripped the box open.\n\n43\n00:04:54,300 --> 00:05:00,760\nThe ball gown flounced out and went waltzing through the powdered air with tissue-paper attendants.\n\n44\n00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:08,780\nIrene clung to the empty box and watched the beautiful gown disappear.\n\n45\n00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,599\nHow could anything so terribly wrong be allowed to happen? Tears froze on her lashes.\n\n46\n00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:25,689\nHer dear mother's hard work, all those days of measuring, cutting, pinning, stitching... for this?\n\n47\n00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:34,719\nAnd the poor duchess! Irene decided she would have to trudge on with just the box and explain everything in person.\n\n48\n00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:44,240\nShe went shuffling through the snow. Would her mother understand, she wondered, that it was the wind's fault, not hers?\n\n49\n00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,149\nWould the duchess be angry? The wind was howling like a wild animal.\n\n50\n00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:59,990\nSuddenly Irene stepped in a hole and fell over with a twisted ankle. She blamed it on the wind.\n\n51\n00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:07,220\n\"Keep quiet!\" She scolded. \"You've done enough damage already. You've spoiled everything! Everything!\"\n\n52\n00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:11,069\nThe wind swallowed up her words.\n\n53\n00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:17,780\nShe sat in the snow in great pain, afraid she wouldn't be able to go on.\n\n54\n00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:24,079\nBut she managed to get to her feet and start moving. It hurt.\n\n55\n00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:31,990\nHome, where she longed to be, where she and her mother could be warm together, was far behind.\n\n56\n00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:41,639\nIt's got to be closer to the palace, she thought. But where any place was in all this snow, she couldn't be sure.\n\n57\n00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:50,460\nShe plowed on, dragging furrows with her sore foot. The short winter day was almost done.\n\n58\n00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,490\n\"Am I still going the right way?\" she wondered. There was no one around to advise her.\n\n59\n00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:07,780\nWhoever else there was in this snow-covered world was far, far away, and safe indoors-- even the animals in their burrows. She went plodding on.\n\n60\n00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:15,900\nSoon night took over. She knew in the dark that the muffled snow was still falling-- she could feel it.\n\n61\n00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:24,520\nShe was cold and alone in the middle of nowhere. Irene was lost.\n\n62\n00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:32,280\nShe had to keep moving. She was hoping she'd come to a house, any house at all, and be taken in.\n\n63\n00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:38,800\nShe badly needed to be in someone's arms. The snow was above her knees now.\n\n64\n00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,379\nShe shoved her way through it, clutching the empty box.\n\n65\n00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:52,720\nShe was asking how long a small person could keep this struggle up, when she realized it was getting lighter.\n\n66\n00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,929\nThere was a soft glow coming from somewhere below her.\n\n67\n00:07:56,929 --> 00:08:05,340\nShe waded toward this glow, and soon was gazing down a long slope at a brightly lit mansion.\n\n68\n00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,460\nIt had to be the palace!\n\n69\n00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:18,100\nIrene pushed forward with all her strength and-- sloosh! thwump!-- she plunged downward and was buried.\n\n70\n00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,990\nShe had fallen off a little cliff.\n\n71\n00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,100\nOnly her hat and the box in her hands stuck out above the snow.\n\n72\n00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:35,100\nEven if she could call for help, no one would hear her. Her body shook. Her teeth chattered.\n\n73\n00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:44,120\n\"Why not freeze to death,\" she thought, \"and let all these troubles end.\"\nWhy not? She was already buried.\n\n74\n00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:55,540\nAnd never see her mother's face again? Her good mother who smelled like fresh-baked bread?\n\n75\n00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:05,780\nIn an explosion of fury, she flung her body about to free herself and was finally able to climb up on her knees and look around.\n\n76\n00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:13,170\nHow to get down to that glittering palace? As soon as she raised the question, she had the answer.\n\n77\n00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,380\nShe laid the box down and climbed aboard.\n\n78\n00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,400\nBut it pressed into the snow and stuck.\n\n79\n00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:33,080\nShe tried again, and this time, instead of climbing on, she leaped. The box shot forward, like a sled.\n\n80\n00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:41,220\nThe wind raced after Irene but couldn't keep up. In a moment she would be with people again, inside where it was warm.\n\n81\n00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,960\nThe sled slowed and jerked to a stop on paving stones.\n\n82\n00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,460\nThe time had come to break the bad news to the duchess.\n\n83\n00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:00,160\nWith the empty box clasped to her chest, Irene strode nervously toward the palace.\n\n84\n00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:08,240\nBut then her feet stopped moving and her mouth fell open. She stared.\n\n85\n00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:16,200\nMaybe this was impossible, yet there it was, a little way off and over to the right, hugging the trunk of a tree--\n\n86\n00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,660\nThe beautiful ball gown! The wind was holding it there.\n\n87\n00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,420\n\"Mama!\" Irene shouted. \"Mama, I found it!\"\n\n88\n00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:37,660\nShe managed somehow, despite the wind's meddling, to get the gown off the tree and back in its box.\n\n89\n00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:46,880\nAnd in another moment she was at the door of the palace. She knocked twice with the big brass knocker.\n\n90\n00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880\nThe door opened and she burst in.\n\n91\n00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,120\nShe was welcomed by cheering servants and a delirious duchess.\n\n92\n00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,420\nThey couldn't believe she had come over the mountain in such a storm, all by herself.\n\n93\n00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,390\nShe had to tell the whole story, every detail. And she did.\n\n94\n00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,620\nThen she asked to be taken right back to her sick mother.\n\n95\n00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:17,970\nBut it was out of the question, they said; the road that ran around the mountain wouldn't be cleared until morning.\n\n96\n00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:27,110\n\"Don't fret, child,\" said the duchess. \"Your mother is surely sleeping now. We'll get you there first thing tomorrow.\"\n\n97\n00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:35,490\nIrene was given a good dinner as she sat by the fire, the moisture steaming off her clothes.\n\n98\n00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:45,100\nThe duchess, meanwhile, got into her freshly ironed gown before the guests began arriving in their sleighs.\n\n99\n00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:55,620\nWhat a wonderfull ball it was! The duchess in her new gown was like a bright star in the sky.\n\n100\n00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,100\nIrene in her ordinary dress was radiant.\n\n101\n00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:08,780\nShe was swept up into dances by handsome aristocrats, who kept her feet off the floor to spare her ankle.\n\n102\n00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:12,500\nHer mother would enjoy hearing all about it.\n\n103\n00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:24,740\nEarly the next morning, when snow had long since ceased falling, Mrs. Bobbin woke from a good night's sleep feeling much improved.\n\n104\n00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:34,140\nShe hurried about and got a fire going in the cold stove. Then she went to look in on Irene.\n\n105\n00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,980\nBut Irene's bed was empty! She ran to the window and gazed at the white landscape.\n\n106\n00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,120\nNo one out there. Snow powder fell from the branch of a tree.\n\n107\n00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,060\n\"Where is my child?\" Mrs. Bobbin cried. She whipped on her coat to go out and find her.\n\n108\n00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,460\nWhen she pulled the door open, a wall of drift faced her.\n\n109\n00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:09,000\nBut peering over it, she could see a horse-drawn sleigh hastening up the path.\n\n110\n00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:18,630\nAnd seated on the sleigh, between two large footmen, was Irene herself, asleep but smiling.\n\n111\n00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,940\nWould you like to hear the rest?\n\n112\n00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:28,940\nWell, there was a bearded doctor in the back of the sleigh...\n\n113\n00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:38,880\nand the duchess had sent Irene's mother a ginger cake with white icing, some oranges and a pineapple, and spice candy of many flavors,\n\n114\n00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:48,000\nalong with a note saying how much she cherished her gown, and what a brave and loving person Irene was.\n\n115\n00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,950\nWhich, of course, Mrs. Bobbin knew. Better than the duchess.\n\n116\n00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,440\nI hope you enjoyed this book, \"Brave Irene.\"",

		"title"		: "The Empty Pot",
		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,020\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:14,440\nI'm Rami Malek, and today I'm going to be reading to you one of my favorite books,\n\n3\n00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,600\nThis is The Empty Pot,\n\n4\n00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,980\nwritten and illustrated by Demi.\n\n5\n00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:30,240\nA long time ago in China there was a boy named Ping who loved flowers.\n\n6\n00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:43,000\nAnything he planted burst into bloom. Up came flowers, bushes, and even big fruit trees, as if by magic!\n\n7\n00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:54,720\nEveryone in the kingdom loved flowers too. They planted them everywhere, and the air smelled like perfume.\n\n8\n00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:06,860\nThe Emperor loved birds and animals, but flowers most of all, and he tended his own garden every day.\n\n9\n00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:15,120\nBut the Emperor was very old. He needed to choose a successor to the throne.\n\n10\n00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,380\nWho would his successor be? And how would the Emperor choose?\n\n11\n00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:30,320\nBecause the Emperor loved flowers so much, he decided to let the flowers choose.\n\n12\n00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,080\nThe next day a proclamation was issued: All the children in the land were to come to the palace.\n\n13\n00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,360\nThere they would be given special flower seeds by the Emperor.\n\n14\n00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,660\n\"Whoever can show me their best in a year's time,\" he said, \"will succeed me to the throne.\"\n\n15\n00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,180\nThis news created great excitement throughout the land!\n\n16\n00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:04,800\nChildren from all over the country swarmed to the palace to get their flower seeds.\n\n17\n00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:15,140\nAll the parents wanted their children to be chosen Emperor, and all the children hoped they would be chosen too!\n\n18\n00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:22,680\nWhen Ping received his seed from the Emperor, he was the happiest child of all.\n\n19\n00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,600\nHe was sure he could grow the most beautiful flower.\n\n20\n00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:36,340\nPing filled a flowerpot with rich soil. He planted the seed in it very carefully.\n\n21\n00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:46,140\nHe watered it every day. He couldn't wait to see it sprout, grow, and blossom into a beautiful flower!\n\n22\n00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,900\nDay after day passed, but nothing grew in his pot.\n\n23\n00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:03,820\nPing was very worried. He put new soil into a bigger pot. Then he transferred the seed into the rich black soil.\n\n24\n00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:11,400\nAnother two months he waited. Still nothing happened.\n\n25\n00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,800\nBy and by the whole year passed.\n\n26\n00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,300\nSpring came, and all the children put on their best clothes to greet the Emperor.\n\n27\n00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,480\nThey rushed to the palace with their beautiful flowers, eagerly hoping to be chosen.\n\n28\n00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,120\nPing was ashamed of his empty pot.\n\n29\n00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,480\nHe thought the other children would laugh at him because for once he couldn't get a flower to grow.\n\n30\n00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:46,540\nHis clever friend ran by, holding a great big plant.\n\n31\n00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:52,780\n\"Ping!\" he said. \"You're not really going to the Emperor with an empty pot, are you?\n\n32\n00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,200\nCouldn't you grow a great big flower like mine?\"\n\n33\n00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:05,420\n\"I've grown lots of flowers better than yours,\" Ping said. \"It's just this seed that won't grow.\"\n\n34\n00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:16,900\nPing's father overheard this and said, \"You did your best, and your best is good enough to present to the Emperor.\"\n\n35\n00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,960\nHolding the empty pot in his hands, Ping went straight away to the palace.\n\n36\n00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,580\nThe Emperor was looking at the flowers slowly, one by one.\n\n37\n00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:41,520\nHow beautiful all the flowers were! But the Emperor was frowning and did not say a word.\n\n38\n00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,780\nFinally he came to Ping.\n\n39\n00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,460\nPing hung his head in shame, expecting to be punished.\n\n40\n00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,920\nThe Emperor asked him, \"Why did you bring an empty pot?\"\n\n41\n00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:12,180\nPing started to cry and replied, \"I planted the seed you gave me and I watered it every day, but it didn't sprout.\n\n42\n00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,620\nI put it in a better pot with better soil, but still it didn't sprout!\n\n43\n00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,940\nI tended it all year long, but nothing grew.\n\n44\n00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:33,280\nSo today I had to bring an empty pot without a flower. It was the best I could do.\n\n45\n00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:45,220\nWhen the Emperor heard these words, a smile slowly spread over his face, and he put his arm around Ping.\n\n46\n00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:57,140\nThen he exclaimed to one and all, \"I have found him! I have found the one person worthy of being Emperor!\n\n47\n00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:05,480\n\"Where you got your seeds from, I do not know. For the seeds I gave you had all been cooked.\n\n48\n00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,900\nSo it was impossible for any of them to grow.\n\n49\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,640\n\"I admire Ping's great courage to appear before me with the empty truth,\n\n50\n00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:26,940\nand now I reward him with my entire kingdom and make him Emperor of all the land!\"\n\n51\n00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:47,900\nWhat I love about The Empty Pot is it does allow me to look inside and realize just how much truth means.\n\n52\n00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:57,000\nBecause ultimately the only consequences are feeling like you're courageous, and honorable, and a bigger person,\n\n53\n00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,520\nand I guarantee you, the truth always wins.\n\n54\n00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,340\nSo thank you to The Empty Pot for such a strong message. Keep telling the truth.\n\n55\n00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:15,060\nThank you guys for watching Storyline Online. Make sure to check out all of our stories.\n\n56\n00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,940\nKeep watching and definitely keep reading.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:07,760\nWelcome to BookPALS Storyline Online brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:14,740\nMy name is Camryn Manheim. You may know me from \"The Practice,\" but I hope not, because it was on way past your bedtime.\n\n3\n00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:22,900\nToday I am going to read \"Enemy Pie,\" written by Derek Munson and illustrated by Tara Calahan King.\n\n4\n00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,500\nIt should have been a perfect summer.\n\n5\n00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,380\nMy dad helped me build a tree house in our backyard. My sister was at camp for three whole weeks.\n\n6\n00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,110\nAnd I was on the best baseball team in town.\n\n7\n00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,040\nIt should have been a perfect summer. But it wasn't.\n\n8\n00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:50,000\nIt was all good until Jeremy Ross moved into the neighborhood, right next door to my best friend Stanley.\n\n9\n00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920\nI did not like Jeremy Ross.\n\n10\n00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:01,060\nHe laughed at me when he struck me out in a baseball game. He had a party on his trampoline, and I wasn't even invited.\n\n11\n00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:09,940\nBut my best friend Stanley was. Jeremy Ross was the one and only person on my enemy list.\n\n12\n00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:17,600\nI never even had an enemy list until he moved into the neighborhood. But as soon as he came along, I needed one.\n\n13\n00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:24,540\nI hung it up in my tree house, where Jeremy Ross was not allowed to go.\n\n14\n00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,840\nDad understood stuff like enemies. He told me that when he was my age he had enemies too.\n\n15\n00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,840\nBut he knew a good way to get rid of them. I asked him to tell me how.\n\n16\n00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:42,210\n\"Tell you how? I'll show you how!\" he said. He pulled a really old recipe book off the kitchen shelf.\n\n17\n00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,340\nInside, there was a worn-out scrap of paper with faded writing. Dad held it up and squinted at it.\n\n18\n00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:53,800\n\"Enemy Pie,\" he said, satisfied.\n\n19\n00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:00,110\nYou may be wondering what exactly is in Enemy Pie. I was wondering, too.\n\n20\n00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,820\nBut Dad said the recipe was so secret, he couldn't even tell me.\n\n21\n00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,739\nI decided it must be magic. I begged him to tell me something– anything.\n\n22\n00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:18,149\n\"I will tell you this,\" he said. \"Enemy Pie is the fastest known way to get rid of enemies.\"\n\n23\n00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:27,069\nNow, of course, this got my mind working. What kinds of things– disgusting things– would I put into a pie for an enemy?\n\n24\n00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,300\nI brought Dad some weeds from the garden, but he just shook his head.\n\n25\n00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:35,859\nI brought him earthworms and rocks, but he didn't think he needed those.\n\n26\n00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:41,060\nI gave him the gum I'd been chewing on all morning. He gave it right back to me.\n\n27\n00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,060\nI went out to play alone. I shot baskets until the ball got stuck on the roof.\n\n28\n00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,560\nI threw a boomerang that never came back to me.\n\n29\n00:02:52,569 --> 00:03:02,019\nAnd all the while, I listened to the sounds of my dad chopping and stirring and blending the ingredients of Enemy Pie.\n\n30\n00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,939\nThis could be a great summer after all.\n\n31\n00:03:06,939 --> 00:03:09,860\nEnemy Pie was going to be awful.\n\n32\n00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:15,069\nI tried to imagine how horrible it must smell, or worse yet, what it was going to look like.\n\n33\n00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:23,700\nBut when I was in the backyard, looking for ladybugs, I smelled something really, really, really good,\n\n34\n00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,120\nand as far as I could tell, it was coming from our kitchen. I was a bit confused.\n\n35\n00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,340\nI went in to ask my Dad what was wrong, Enemy Pie shouldn't smell this good. But Dad was smart.\n\n36\n00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:43,360\n\"If Enemy Pie smelled bad, your enemy would never eat it,\" he said. I could tell he'd made Enemy Pie before.\n\n37\n00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,060\nThe buzzer rang, and Dad put on the oven mitts and pulled the pie out of the oven.\n\n38\n00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,500\nIt looked like plain old pie. It looked good enough to eat!\n\n39\n00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,979\nI was catching on.\n\n40\n00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,180\nBut still, I wasn't really sure how this Enemy Pie worked. What exactly did it do to enemies?\n\n41\n00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,760\nMaybe it made their hair fall out, or their breath stinky. Maybe it made bullies cry.\n\n42\n00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,999\nI asked Dad, but he was no help.  He wouldn't tell me a thing.\n\n43\n00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,820\nBut while the pie cooled, he filled me in on my job.\n\n44\n00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:26,300\nHe talked quietly. \"There is one part of Enemy Pie that I can't do. In order for it to work, you need to spend a day with your enemy.\n\n45\n00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,480\nEven worse, you have to be nice to him. It's not easy.\n\n46\n00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,440\nBut that's the only way that Enemy Pie can work. Are you sure you want to go through with this?\"\n\n47\n00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:41,700\nOf course I was. It sounded horrible. It was scary. But it was worth a try.\n\n48\n00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,199\nAll I had to do was spend one day with Jeremy Ross, then he'd be out of my hair for the rest of my life.\n\n49\n00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,289\nI rode my bike to his house and knocked on the door.\n\n50\n00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:57,040\nWhen Jeremy opened the door, he seemed surprised.\n\n51\n00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,960\nHe stood on the other side of the screen door and looked at me, waiting for me to say something.\n\n52\n00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,020\nI was nervous. \"Can you play?\" I asked. He looked confused.\n\n53\n00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:16,099\n\"I'll go ask my mom,\" he said. He came back with his shoes in his hand. His mom walked around the corner to say hello.\n\n54\n00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,360\n\"You boys stay out of trouble,\" she said, smiling.\n\n55\n00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,680\nWe rode bikes for a while and played on the trampoline.\n\n56\n00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,120\nThen we made some water balloons and threw them at the neighborhood girls, but we missed.\n\n57\n00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,620\nJeremy's mom made us lunch. After lunch we went over to my house.\n\n58\n00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:41,689\nIt was strange, but I was kind of having fun with my enemy. He almost seemed nice.\n\n59\n00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:46,620\nBut of course I couldn't tell Dad that, since he had worked so hard to make the Enemy Pie.\n\n60\n00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:54,420\nJeremy Ross liked my basketball hoop. He said he wished he had a basketball hoop, but they didn't have room for one.\n\n61\n00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,880\nI let him win a game, just to be nice.\n\n62\n00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,500\nJeremy Ross knew how to throw a boomerang. He threw it and it came right back to him.\n\n63\n00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,280\nI threw it and it went over my house and into the backyard.\n\n64\n00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:16,629\nWhen we climbed over the fence to find it, the first thing Jeremy noticed was my tree house.\n\n65\n00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,620\nMy tree house was my tree house. I was the boss.\n\n66\n00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:26,520\nIf my sister wanted in, I didn't have to let her. If my dad wanted in, I didn't have to let him.\n\n67\n00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,900\nAnd Jeremy Ross wanted in.\n\n68\n00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,160\n\"Can we go in it?\" he asked.\n\n69\n00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,040\nI knew he was going to ask me that! But he was the top person, the ONLY person, on my enemy list.\n\n70\n00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,680\nAnd enemies aren't allowed in my tree house.\n\n71\n00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:51,180\nBut he did teach me to throw a boomerang. And he did have me over for lunch. And he did let me play on his trampoline.\n\n72\n00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,349\nHe wasn't being a very good enemy.\n\n73\n00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:01,529\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"but hold on.\" \nI climbed up ahead of him and tore the enemy list off the wall.\n\n74\n00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:07,739\nI had a checkerboard and some cards in the tree house, and we played games until my dad called us down for dinner.\n\n75\n00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:12,550\nWe pretended we didn't hear him, and when he came out to get us, we tried to hide from him.\n\n76\n00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,940\nBut somehow he found us.\n\n77\n00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,360\nDad made us macaroni and cheese for dinner– my favorite. It was Jeremy's favorite, too!\n\n78\n00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,800\nMaybe Jeremy Ross wasn't so bad after all.\n\n79\n00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,720\nI was beginning to think that maybe we should just forget about Enemy Pie.\n\n80\n00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,200\nBut sure enough, after dinner, Dad brought out the pie. I watched as he cut the pie into eight thick slices.\n\n81\n00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,279\n\"Dad,\" I said, \"It sure is nice having a new friend in the neighborhood.\"\n\n82\n00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:50,509\nI was trying to get his attention and trying to tell him that Jeremy Ross was no longer my enemy. But Dad only smiled and nodded.\n\n83\n00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,880\nI think he thought I was just pretending.\n\n84\n00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,540\nDad dished up three plates, side by side, with big pieces of pie and giant scoops of ice cream.\n\n85\n00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,120\nHe passed one to me and one to Jeremy.\n\n86\n00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,500\n\"Wow!\" Jeremy said, looking at the pie, \"my dad never makes pies like this.\"\n\n87\n00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:15,340\nIt was at this point that I panicked. I didn't want Jeremy to eat Enemy Pie!\n\n88\n00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,780\nHe was my friend! I couldn't let him eat it!\n\n89\n00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:22,220\n\"Jeremy, don't eat it! It's bad pie! I think it's poisonous or something!\"\n\n90\n00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,300\nJeremy's fork stopped before reaching his mouth. He crumpled his eyebrows and looked at me funny.\n\n91\n00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:34,880\nI felt relieved. I had saved his life. I was a hero.\n\n92\n00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,320\n\"If it's so bad,\" Jeremy asked, \"then why has your dad already eaten half of it?\"\n\n93\n00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,940\nI turned to look at my dad. Sure enough, he was eating Enemy Pie!\n\n94\n00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,580\n\"Good stuff,\" he mumbled through a mouthful. And that was all he said.\n\n95\n00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,840\nI sat there watching them eat Enemy Pie for a few seconds.\n\n96\n00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,880\nDad was laughing. Jeremy was happily eating. And neither of them was losing any hair!\n\n97\n00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,660\nIt seemed safe enough, so I took a tiny taste.\n\n98\n00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,160\nEnemy Pie was delicious!\n\n99\n00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,200\nAfter dessert, Jeremy rode his bike home but not before inviting me over to play on his trampoline in the morning.\n\n100\n00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,800\nHe said he'd teach me how to flip.\n\n101\n00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,560\nAs for Enemy Pie, I still don't know how to make it.\n\n102\n00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:33,340\nI still wonder if enemies really do hate it or if their hair falls out or their breath turns bad.\n\n103\n00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:41,120\nBut I don't know if I'll ever get an answer, because I just lost my best enemy.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:06,439\nHi, Welcome to the Screen Actors Guild Foundation BookPALS.\n\n2\n00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:11,379\nI'm Amanda Bynes, you may know me from \"All That,\" or Nickelodeon's \"The Amanda Show,\" or  \"Big Fat Liar.\"\n\n3\n00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:16,020\nToday I'm going to be reading a story about a dog, and I have two dogs so I thought it was a pretty cool idea.\n\n4\n00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,560\nIt's called \"The Night I Followed the Dog.\" It's written and illustrated by Nina Laden.\n\n5\n00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:29,960\nI have a dog. Nothing exotic or special, just an ordinary dog. In fact I always thought he was a boring dog.\n\n6\n00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:37,000\nWhat I mean is he can fetch, roll over and shake hands, but mostly he sleeps and eats.\n\n7\n00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,300\nI used to think that our nextdoor neighbors had the best dog in the world.\n\n8\n00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,940\nTheir dog can sing and change the channels on the TV. Their dog always wins medals in obedience school.\n\n9\n00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,720\nBut I don't think their dog is so great now. Not since the night I followed my dog.\n\n10\n00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,900\nEvery night I let my dog out and he runs off into the darkness with his tail wagging.\n\n11\n00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:03,760\nThe next morning, I let him in and he heads straight for the food bowl.\n\n12\n00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:13,680\nBut one morning I knew something was funny, when I opened the door a little bit earlier than usual and I saw my dog jump out of a limousine wearing a tuxedo.\n\n13\n00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,520\nBefore I could look twice, he disappeared into the backyard and I opened the kitchen door and whistled.\n\n14\n00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,560\nWhen he came into the house he was the same as he always is. Hungry!\n\n15\n00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,960\nI really wasn't sure if I believed what I had seen.\n\n16\n00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,920\nSo that night I decided to follow him.\n\n17\n00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:39,100\nI wore dark clothing so I wouldn't be noticed, and I left my bicycle near the door so I'd have it close by.\n\n18\n00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:44,700\nWhen I let the dog out, I slipped out too. I took out the garbage so he wouldn't suspect anything.\n\n19\n00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,220\nThe dog went straight to his doghouse.\n\n20\n00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,660\nI saw a light go on inside. Slowly I snuck around the backyard and peeked into the doghouse.\n\n21\n00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,680\nThis is not the doghouse that I had helped build.\n\n22\n00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,000\nInside there was a living room, a bathroom, and a huge closet full of fancy clothes.\n\n23\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,140\nThe dog was in the bathroom. He was wearing a tuxedo and fumbling with a bowtie.\n\n24\n00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,600\nWhen he came out, he casually walked out of the doghouse, across the yard, and down the street.\n\n25\n00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,560\nI grabbed my bicycle and followed him. Two blocks later, I saw a limousine pull over.\n\n26\n00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,420\nThe dog got in and the car took off. I started peddling faster.\n\n27\n00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,560\nThe car headed across town. I thought I would lose them, but luckily they were stopped by a few red lights.\n\n28\n00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,839\nAfter a while, I found myself in a part of town that I'd never seen before.\n\n29\n00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,760\nThe buildings all seemed to be empty and it was very quiet. The limousine stopped.\n\n30\n00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,720\nI hid and watched my dog get out. He disappeared into a building and the limousine pulled away.\n\n31\n00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,540\nThere was nothing on the outside of the building, just two brass fire hydrants on either side of the entrance.\n\n32\n00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:02,380\nI opened the door. At the end of the hall there was a neon sign that said The Dog House. I crept closer.\n\n33\n00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:07,100\nIt looked like some kind of club. I decided to get a closer look.\n\n34\n00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:14,120\nThe moment I opened the door, two mean-looking bulldogs appeared and said, \"You can't come in here.\"\n\n35\n00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:21,700\nI didn't know what to say, so I said, \"But, but... I saw my dog. I mean, I think my dog's in here.\"\n\n36\n00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,460\nJust then, my dog walked over and said, \"It's okay boys, he's with me.\"\n\n37\n00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,600\nThe bulldog said, \"Sure boss, uh, whatever you say boss.\"\n\n38\n00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,920\nFor a minute, it seemed like forever, I waited.\n\n39\n00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:43,099\nThen my dog said, \"I knew you'd find out eventually. Well, now you know. This is my place.\"\n\n40\n00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,760\nI looked around. Finally I asked, \"What is this place?\"\n\n41\n00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,169\nMy dog said, \"This, this is a place where dogs come after a hard day.\n\n42\n00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:02,360\nIt's a place where we can relax. It's a place where we can talk about our problems with the mailman or with the poodle next door.\n\n43\n00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:10,760\nSee all the sofas? We can sit on the sofas here. We can get treats without having to lie down, roll over, or play dead.\n\n44\n00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,740\nAnd if we want to chew on a shoe or chase our tail, no one will stop us.\n\n45\n00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:25,780\nWe have no masters here, no leashes, and no rolled-up newspapers. This, this is a place where dogs can be dogs.\"\n\n46\n00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,080\nWe sat down. A cocker spaniel came by and asked me if I would like a bowl of water or some biscuits.\n\n47\n00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,639\nLittle by little dogs of all kinds started coming in.\n\n48\n00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:46,000\nSome danced. Some talked. They all looked at me a little funny, but when they saw who I was with, they smiled and shook my hand.\n\n49\n00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,600\nAt one point, my dog waved to an Afghan with a camera. She came over to our table and took a picture of us together.\n\n50\n00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:57,560\nBeing with my dog made me feel like a movie star.\n\n51\n00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,940\nJust when I was really starting to enjoy myself, I looked at my watch.\n\n52\n00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,460\nI told my dog I had to leave or I'd get in trouble. He nodded.\n\n53\n00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,840\nI think he was about to say something, but a glamorous greyhound grabbed his paw and whisked him onto the dance floor.\n\n54\n00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,719\nAs he was getting up, he tossed me the photo of the two of us.\n\n55\n00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,500\nThen he bowed slightly and disappeared into the crowd.\n\n56\n00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,340\nIt was way past my bedtime.\n\n57\n00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:35,280\nAs I peddled home into the cool night, I thought to myself, \"Now I'm really going to be in the doghouse. But then again, that might not be so bad.\"\n\n58\n00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,000\nThe End.\n\n59\n00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:42,820\nWhat'd you think? Yeah, I thought it was really great, too. I should go home and read this to my dogs.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,340\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to\nyou by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,840\nI'm Rashida Jones, and today I'm going to\nread Please Please the Bees,\n\n3\n00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,800\nwritten and illustrated by Gerald Kelly.\n\n4\n00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:21,340\nBenedict was a creature of habit. He liked to do the same thing every day.\n\n5\n00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,380\nEvery morning he woke up at the same time. Every morning he stretched.\n\n6\n00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,080\nHe scratched. He yawned a\ngreat yawn.\n\n7\n00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:34,640\nEvery morning the bees delivered three\njars full of honey.\n\n8\n00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,820\nBenedict ate the same breakfast he'd\neaten since he was just a fuzzy cub:\ntoast with honey and tea with extra\nhoney.\n\n9\n00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:53,020\nNext came his daily routine: practicing, perfecting his honey cake recipe, \nknitting, and running errands.\n\n10\n00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,000\nAt night he'd read then have one last\ncup of honey tea before bed. Life was sweet.\n\n11\n00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,900\nUntil one morning... one morning\nthings weren't the same.\n\n12\n00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,360\nIn fact, something terribly un-same had happened.\n\n13\n00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,140\nThere was no more honey. The bees had\ngone on strike!\n\n14\n00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,680\nBenedict's breakfast wasn't the same\nwithout honey.\nWithout his honey tea, he couldn't knit.\n\n15\n00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,200\nPractice was dreadful. He didn't even bother with the errands.\n\n16\n00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:36,920\nBenedict became deeply discouraged. Just then he heard someone say, \"Hey, you! In the fur coat!\"\n\n17\n00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,100\nIt was a very small bee with a remarkably loud voice. \"We need to talk!\" said the bee.\n\n18\n00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:50,100\n\"Talk? Hmmph!\" grumbled Benedict. \"I let you all live in my yard. All I ask is for a few jars of honey.\"\n\n19\n00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,060\n\"You should be grateful. Not go on strike!\"\n\n20\n00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,040\n\"A few jars?\" said the bee. \"Buddy, we deliver three jars of honey to you every day.\"\n\n21\n00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,180\n\"Every month! Every year! Do the math, Einstein!”\n\n22\n00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,300\n“The hive is a wreck!” the bee continued.  “It’s all we can do to keep the walls from falling in!\"\n\n23\n00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,240\n\"The roof leaks. Wind blows through the cracks.\"\n\n24\n00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,600\n\"The last three queens up and quit on us because of the lousy work conditions.\"\n\n25\n00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,540\nThe bee showed Benedict the garden. \"Look!\" the bee said. \"Weeds everywhere.\"\n\n26\n00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,920\n\"We have to fly miles away just to find enough flowers to make our honey. So we voted to strike.”\n\n27\n00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:34,600\n\"You’re taking us for granted,” the bee declared. “You want honey? Things need to change. It’s up to you, bear.”\n\n28\n00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,120\nAnd with that, the very small bee flew off.\n\n29\n00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,280\nThe thought of losing his honey sent a chill down Benedict’s spine. He had a lot to think about.\n\n30\n00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:54,320\n“Maybe I’ve been too selfish,” Benedict said to himself. “I never thought about what the bees need. \nBut how am I going to make this right?\"\n\n31\n00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:02,460\nSo he did some research. He did a little shopping.\nAnd he did a lot of work.\n\n32\n00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,200\nBenedict even learned how to harvest honey.\n\n33\n00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,520\n“I suppose it’s a bit rude to expect them to do it all themselves,” he thought.\n\n34\n00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,260\nFinally, he was ready to show the bees all the work he’d done. What would they think?\n\n35\n00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,920\nHe held his breath as he waited. Then he heard the remarkably loud voice of the very small bee…\n\n36\n00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,320\n“DROP THE SIGNS, GIRLS!

Because that's the best part about being in a community,\n\n44\n00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,300\nis being able to live together and have everybody's life be sweet at the same time.\n\n45\n00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,680\nThank you for watching Storyline Online. \nMake sure to watch all our other stories.\n\n46\n00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,180\nKeep watching and keep reading!",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,119\nHello, welcome to Storyline Online brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:17,600\nI'm CCH Pounder and today I'm reading Sophie's Masterpiece by Eileen Spinelli. The illustrations are by Jane Dyer.\n\n3\n00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,800\nIt's a spider's tale.\n\n4\n00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:28,519\nSophie was no ordinary house spider. Sophie was an artist.\n\n5\n00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,880\nShe spun webs more wondrous than anyone had ever seen.\n\n6\n00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,720\nHer playmates called her incredible. Her mama was proud.\n\n7\n00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,640\nSomeday, they said, she's going to spin a masterpiece.\n\n8\n00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,760\nWhen Sophie arrived at the age when a young spider must strike out on her own, she moved to Beekman's Boardinghouse.\n\n9\n00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:04,860\nThe first thing she did was look around. She saw dull green walls, faded rugs, and old window shades. The place cried out for her talents.\n\n10\n00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:13,180\nSophie set to work. Her first project was to weave a web of curtains for Beekman's front parlor.\n\n11\n00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:20,040\nDay after day she whizzed along, blending a golden thread of sun into her silk.\n\n12\n00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:33,500\nThen one day the landlady noticed her and screamed, \"I'll have no spiders in my parlor!\" She swatted at Sophie with a dust rag.\n\n13\n00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:43,660\nSophie knew when she wasn't wanted. She scampered across the wall and up the stairs into the tugboat captain's closet.\n\n14\n00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:52,220\nWhen she finally settled down, she looked around and saw nothing but gray. Gray shirts. Gray pants. Gray sweaters.\n\n15\n00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:59,360\nThe captain needs a new suit, Sophie decided. Something bright. Blue. Like sky.\n\n16\n00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,540\nShe began to spin patiently. A sleeve. A collar.\n\n17\n00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,420\nOne day the tugboat captain caught Sophie at work. He screeched, \"A spider!\"'\n\n18\n00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:18,979\nThen he climbed onto the windowsill and out onto the roof. Sophie did not want anyone falling off the roof on her account.\n\n19\n00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:25,650\nShe scuttled out of the closet, down the hall, and into the cook's bedroom slipper.\n\n20\n00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,340\nCook's bedroom slippers were patched and dirty.\n\n21\n00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,209\nI'll spin Cook a new pair, Sophie thought. After I rest a bit.\n\n22\n00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:45,460\nNo sooner had Sophie snuggled into the toe, than she was being flung to the floor. Was it an earthquake? No.\n\n23\n00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:53,940\nIt was Cook who had shaken Sophie out. \"Yuck!\" scowled Cook. \"Look at that ugly, disgusting spider.\"\n\n24\n00:02:53,940 --> 00:03:01,800\nSophie's feelings were hurt. With great dignity she journeyed across the rug and under Cook's door.\n\n25\n00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,800\nShe made the long, long climb up the steep stairs to the third floor where a young woman lived.\n\n26\n00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:16,820\nWearily Sophie slipped into the young woman's knitting basket and fell asleep.\n\n27\n00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,860\nBy this time, many spider years had passed. Sophie was older.\n\n28\n00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,560\nShe only had energy to spin a few small things for herself...\n\n29\n00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:36,899\n…a tiny rose-patterned case for her pillow, eight colorful socks to keep her legs warm. But mostly, she slept.\n\n30\n00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,600\nThen one day the young woman discovered Sophie.\n\n31\n00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:51,700\nOh, no, thought Sophie, close to tears. She knew she did not have the strength for any more journeys.\n\n32\n00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:57,380\nBut the young woman did not swat at Sophie with a dust rag. She did not climb on the roof.\n\n33\n00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:03,560\nShe did not say that Sophie was ugly. She simply smiled.\n\n34\n00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,120\nAnd without disturbing Sophie in the least, the young woman picked up her needle and yarn.\n\n35\n00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,940\nSophie watched as the young woman knitted, day after day.\n\n36\n00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:24,080\n\"Booties!\" cried Sophie. The young woman was going to have a baby.\n\n37\n00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,800\nAfter the booties were finished, the young woman knitted a baby sweater. Then the yarn was gone.\n\n38\n00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,440\nThe young woman did not have enough money to buy yarn for a baby blanket.\n\n39\n00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,420\n\"Never mind,\" the landlady said. \"There's an old brown quilt in the hall closet. Your baby can use that.\"\n\n40\n00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:53,000\nSophie had seen that quilt. It was scratchy and drab. Not fit for a baby.\n\n41\n00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,100\nSophie knew the answer. She had to spin a blanket herself.\n\n42\n00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,320\nIn her younger days, this would not have been a problem. But Sophie had grown frail and weak.\n\n43\n00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,700\nThe baby was due any day. Could Sophie complete the blanket in time?\n\n44\n00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:20,570\nShe climbed out of the yarn basket. She traveled to the wide windowsill. Strands of moonlight fell into the room.\n\n45\n00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:29,520\nExcellent! She thought. I'll weave these strands into the baby's blanket. Some starlight, too.\n\n46\n00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,640\nSophie began. As she spun, new ideas came to her.\n\n47\n00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:46,420\nShe worked them into the blanket. Snippets of fragrant pine... wisps of night... old lullabies... playful snowflakes...\n\n48\n00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:54,180\nSophie spun without blinking. Or eating. Or sleeping.\n\n49\n00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:03,700\nShe was never more exhausted. Or determined. On and on she spun.\n\n50\n00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:11,400\nShe was down to the farthest corner of the blanket when she heard the cry of the young woman's newborn baby.\n\n51\n00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:23,020\nAnd there, on that farthest corner, is where Sophie wove into the blanket her very own heart.\n\n52\n00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:33,620\nThat night as the young woman was about to cover her infant with the landlady's quilt, something on the windowsill caught her eye.\n\n53\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:47,200\nIt was a blanket, so soft, so beautiful as to be fit for a prince. The young woman knew this was no ordinary blanket.\n\n54\n00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:57,740\nShe placed it with love and wonderment around her sleeping baby. And went to sleep herself with her hand upon the little spider's last spinning.\n\n55\n00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,040\nSophie's masterpiece.\n\n56\n00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,560\nThe End.",

And you must fetch the water.\n\n22\n00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,700\nFor this, I will give you three coins and a place to sleep and food to eat.\"\n\n23\n00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,840\n\"Oh grazie,\" said Big Anthony.\n\n24\n00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:45,200\n\"The one thing you must never do,\" said Strega Nona,\n\n25\n00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,260\n\"is touch the pasta pot.\n\n26\n00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,940\nIt is very valuable and I don't let anyone touch it!\"\n\n27\n00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:58,199\n\"Oh sì, yes,\" said Big Anthony.\n\n28\n00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,440\nAnd so the days went by. Big Anthony did his work\n\n29\n00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,160\nand Strega Nona met with the people who came to see her\n\n30\n00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,100\nfor headaches and husbands and warts.\n\n31\n00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,860\nBig Anthony had a nice bed to sleep in next to the goat shed,\n\n32\n00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,780\nand he had food to eat.\n\n33\n00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,940\nOne evening when Big Anthony was milking the goat,\n\n34\n00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,330\nhe heard Strega Nona singing.\n\n35\n00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,180\nPeeking in the window,\n\n36\n00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,220\nhe saw Strega Nona standing over the pasta pot.\n\n37\n00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,560\nShe sang,\n\n38\n00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,380\nBubble, bubble, pasta pot,\n\n39\n00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,300\nBoil me some pasta, nice and hot,\n\n40\n00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,220\nI'm hungry and it's time to sup,\n\n41\n00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,460\nBoil me some pasta to fill me up.\n\n42\n00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,340\nAnd the pasta pot bubbled and boiled and was soon filled\n\n43\n00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,120\nwith steaming hot pasta.\n\n44\n00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,220\nThen Strega Nona sang,\n\n45\n00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,360\nEnough, enough, pasta pot,\n\n46\n00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,920\nI have my pasta, nice and hot\n\n47\n00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,980\nSo simmer down my pot of clay,\n\n48\n00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:15,020\n'Til I'm hungry another day.\n\n49\n00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,640\n\"How wonderful!\" said Big Anthony.\n\n50\n00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,900\n\"That's a magic pot for sure!\"\n\n51\n00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,180\nAnd Strega Nona called Big Anthony in for supper.\n\n52\n00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,320\nBut too bad for Big Anthony, because he didn't get to\n\n53\n00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,760\nsee Strega Nona blow three kisses\n\n54\n00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,400\nto the magic pot.\n\n55\n00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,660\nAnd this is what happened.\n\n56\n00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,640\nThe next day when Big Anthony went to the town square\n\n57\n00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,820\nto fetch the water,\n\n58\n00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,440\nhe told everyone about the pasta pot.\n\n59\n00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,140\nAnd naturally everyone laughed at him,\n\n60\n00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,720\nbecause it sounded so silly —\n\n61\n00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,599\na pot that cooked all by itself.\n\n62\n00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,180\n\"You'd better go and confess to the priest,\n\n63\n00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,559\nBig Anthony,\" they said. \"Such a lie!\"\n\n64\n00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,580\nAnd Big Anthony was angry\n\n65\n00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,380\nand that wasn't a very good thing to be.\n\n66\n00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,420\n\"I'll show them!\" He said to himself.\n\n67\n00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,200\n\"Someday I will get the pasta pot and make it cook!\n\n68\n00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,580\nAnd then they'll be sorry.\"\n\n69\n00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,580\nThat day came sooner than even Big Anthony could have thought,\n\n70\n00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,200\nbecause two days later Strega Nona said to Big Anthony,\n\n71\n00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,080\n\"Anthony, I must go over the mountain to the next town\n\n72\n00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,260\nto see my friend, Strega Amelia.\n\n73\n00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,340\nSweep the house and weed the garden.\n\n74\n00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,240\nFeed the goat and milk her, and for your lunch,\n\n75\n00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,520\nthere's some bread and cheese in the cupboard.\n\n76\n00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,320\nAnd remember, don't touch the pasta pot.\"\n\n77\n00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,900\n\"Oh, yes—yes—Strega Nona,\" said Big Anthony.\n\n78\n00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,380\nBut inside he was thinking, my chance has come!\n\n79\n00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,060\nAs soon as Strega Nona was out of sight,\n\n80\n00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,700\nBig Anthony went inside,\n\n81\n00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,300\npulled the pasta pot off the shelf, and put it on the floor.\n\n82\n00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,220\n\"Now, let's see if I can remember the words,\" said Big Anthony.\n\n83\n00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,460\nAnd Big Anthony sang,\n\n84\n00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,860\nand you feel free to sing along with me if you remember the words.\n\n85\n00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,800\nBubble, bubble, pasta pot,\n\n86\n00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,600\nBoil me some pasta, nice and hot,\n\n87\n00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,500\nI'm hungry and it's time to sup,\n\n88\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,300\nBoil enough to fill me up.\n\n89\n00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,100\nAnd sure enough, the pot bubbled and boiled\n\n90\n00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,560\nand began to fill up with pasta.\n\n91\n00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:53,520\n\"Aha!\" said Big Anthony, and he ran to the town square,\n\n92\n00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,720\njumped on the fountain, and shouted,\n\n93\n00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:59,940\n\"Everybody get forks and plates and platters and bowls.\n\n94\n00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,600\nPasta for all at Strega Nona's house.\n\n95\n00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,440\nBig Anthony has made the magic pasta pot work.\"\n\n96\n00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,660\nOf course everyone laughed, but ran home\n\n97\n00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:15,340\nto get forks and plates and platters and bowls,\n\n98\n00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,640\nand sure enough, when they got to Strega Nona's\n\n99\n00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,620\nthe pasta pot was so full it was beginning to overflow.\n\n100\n00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,780\nBig Anthony was a hero!\n\n101\n00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:32,100\nHe scooped out pasta and filled the plates and platters and bowls.\n\n102\n00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,460\nThere was more than enough for all the townspeople,\n\n103\n00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,300\nincluding the priests and the sisters from the convent.\n\n104\n00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:43,260\nAnd some people came back for two and three helpings,\n\n105\n00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,580\nbut the pot was never empty.\n\n106\n00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:51,720\nWhen all had had their fill, Big Anthony sang,\n\n107\n00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,480\nEnough, enough, pasta pot,\n\n108\n00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,220\nI have my pasta nice and hot.\n\n109\n00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,280\nSo simmer down, my pot of clay\n\n110\n00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,140\nUntil I’m hungry another day\n\n111\n00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,760\nBut, alas, he did not blow the three kisses!\n\n112\n00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,800\nHe went outside and to the applause of the crowd,\n\n113\n00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,180\nBig Anthony took a bow.\n\n114\n00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,760\nHe was so busy listening to compliments from everyone\n\n115\n00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,500\nthat he didn’t notice\nthe pasta pot was still bubbling and boiling,\n\n116\n00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,150\nuntil a sister from the convent said,\n\n117\n00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,620\n“Oh, Big Anthony, look!”\n\n118\n00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,560\nAnd pasta was pouring out of the pot all over the floor\n\n119\n00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,280\nof Strega Nona’s house\nand was coming out the door!\n\n120\n00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,540\nBig Anthony rushed in and shouted the magic words again,\n\n121\n00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,260\nbut the pot kept bubbling.\n\n122\n00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,460\nHe took the pot off the floor, but pasta kept pouring from it.\n\n123\n00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:04,020\nBig Anthony grabbed a cover and put it on the pot and sat on it.\n\n124\n00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,340\nBut the pasta raised the cover, and Big Anthony as well,\n\n125\n00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,120\nand spilled on the floor of Strega Nona’s house.\n\n126\n00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,520\n“Stop!” yelled Big Anthony.\n\n127\n00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,040\nBut the pasta did not stop\n\n128\n00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,160\nand if someone hadn’t grabbed poor Big Anthony,\n\n129\n00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,140\nthe pasta would have covered him up.\n\n130\n00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,920\nThe pasta had all but filled the little house.\n\n131\n00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,940\nOut of the windows and through the doors came the pasta\n\n132\n00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,840\nand the pot kept right on bubbling.\n\n133\n00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,000\nThe townspeople began to worry.\n\n134\n00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,480\n“Do something, Big Anthony,” they shouted.\n\n135\n00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,020\nBig Anthony sang the magic song again\n\n136\n00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,220\nbut without the three kisses it did\nno good!\n\n137\n00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:52,900\nBy this time the pasta was on its way down the road\n\n138\n00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,260\nand all the people were\nrunning to keep ahead of it.\n\n139\n00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,660\n“We must protect our town from the pasta,” shouted the mayor.\n\n140\n00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,720\n“Get mattresses, tables, doors —\nanything to make a barricade.”\n\n141\n00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,120\nBut even that didn’t work.\n\n142\n00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,380\nThe pot kept bubbling and the pasta kept coming!\n\n143\n00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,300\n“We are lost,” said the people,\n\n144\n00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,000\nand the priest and the sisters of the convent began praying.\n\n145\n00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,500\n“The pasta will cover our town,” they cried.\n\n146\n00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,580\nAnd it certainly would have,\n\n147\n00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,120\nhad Strega Nona not come down the road,\nhome from her visit.\n\n148\n00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,680\nShe didn’t have to look twice to know what had happened.\n\n149\n00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,480\nShe sang the magic song and blew the three kisses\n\n150\n00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,900\nand with a sputter the pot stopped boiling\n\n151\n00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,720\nand the pasta came to a halt.\n\n152\n00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,180\n“Oh, grazie—thank you, thank you, Strega Nona,” the people cried.\n\n153\n00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,340\nBut then they turned on poor Big Anthony.\n\n154\n00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,980\n“String him up,” the men of the town shouted.\n\n155\n00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,920\n“Now, wait,” said Strega Nona.\n\n156\n00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,160\n“The punishment must fit the crime.”\n\n157\n00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,020\nAnd she took a fork from a lady standing nearby\n\n158\n00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,220\nand held it out to Big Anthony.\n\n159\n00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,960\n“All right, Anthony,\n\n160\n00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,600\nyou wanted pasta from my magic pasta pot,” \nStrega Nona said,\n\n161\n00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,360\n“and I want to sleep in my little bed tonight.\n\n162\n00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,960\nSo start eating.”\n\n163\n00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320\nAnd he did —\n\n164\n00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,040\npoor Big Anthony.\n\n165\n00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,660\nThe end.\n\n166\n00:10:38,440 -->

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:09,809\nHi everybody, welcome to Storyline Online. It's brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:22,880\nI'm Annette Bening and I'm here today to read The Tooth, written by Avi Slodovnik and illustrated by Manon Gauthier.\n\n3\n00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,380\nMarissa's love of candy finally caught up with her.\n\n4\n00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:34,840\nThat morning she woke up with a toothache and instead of bringing her to school, her mother took her to the dentist.\n\n5\n00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,720\nMarissa didn't often go downtown. Columns of tall, gray buildings cast great shadows across the streets.\n\n6\n00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:50,270\nThe sky, usually bright and blue, was barely visible between the rows of endlessly tall skyscrapers.\n\n7\n00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,420\nMarissa and her mother walked hand-in-hand toward the dentist's office.\n\n8\n00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:04,559\nMen and women wearing long coats and long faces, their collars up and their heads down, rushed in every direction.\n\n9\n00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,030\nMarissa leaned closer to her mother.\n\n10\n00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:13,250\nWhen they stopped at the corner for the light to change, Marissa noticed something unusual.\n\n11\n00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:21,000\nA man with a large nose and dark eyes was sitting on a grate in the sidewalk.\n\n12\n00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,580\nIn front of him was an open shoebox with money inside.\n\n13\n00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:33,770\nMarissa had never seen anyone like him. She wanted to take a closer look but her mother held her hand tightly.\n\n14\n00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,920\nAs they crossed the street to the dentist's building, Marissa looked back and watched the man over her shoulder.\n\n15\n00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000\nHe sat quietly, watching the people pass him by.\n\n16\n00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:55,000\nUp in the dentist's office they checked in with the receptionist who told them to sit in the waiting room until the dentist was ready to see them.\n\n17\n00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,200\nMarissa's mother sat on the couch crossing her legs and flipped through a magazine.\n\n18\n00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:08,030\nInstead of reading a book or playing with a toy, Marissa looked out the window to the busy street below.\n\n19\n00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,860\nThe man was still sitting on the grate. Most people walked by the man.\n\n20\n00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,919\nSome people, just a few, dropped coins into his shoebox.\n\n21\n00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,220\nOne man in a hurry actually stepped over the man.\n\n22\n00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,499\nFinally, after a long wait, Marissa was called into the examination room.\n\n23\n00:02:30,499 --> 00:02:34,369\nShe sat in the big chair and opened her mouth as wide as she could.\n\n24\n00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:40,989\nThe dentist saw a small, brown hole in Marissa's tooth.\n\n25\n00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:46,239\n\"That's quite a cavity,\" he said, \"the tooth will have to come out.\"\n\n26\n00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,960\nA few minutes later, the dentist pulled out Marissa's tooth.\n\n27\n00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,420\nMarissa wished she was in school.\n\n28\n00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:01,340\n\"Here's your tooth, Marissa,\" said the dentist, slipping the tiny tooth into a small, orange envelope.\n\n29\n00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,800\n\"Make sure to put it under your pillow,\" said her mother.\n\n30\n00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,619\n\"Make sure you brush your teeth twice a day, and especially after candy,\" said the dentist.\n\n31\n00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,899\nThey left the dentist's office and in the elevator Marissa asked her mother,\n\n32\n00:03:15,899 --> 00:03:20,409\n\"Is there really a tooth fairy?\"\n\n33\n00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,920\nOutside the dentist's office, the air was cool.\n\n34\n00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:31,360\nMarissa tickled the place her tooth had been with her tongue. It felt funny.\n\n35\n00:03:31,369 --> 00:03:37,059\nThey crossed the street. The man was still sitting on the sidewalk.\n\n36\n00:03:37,059 --> 00:03:42,579\nMarissa tried to get closer, but her mother held her hand tightly, like before.\n\n37\n00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:51,300\nMarissa pulled away and went up to the shoebox. There wasn't a lot of money inside.\n\n38\n00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:59,120\nMarissa held open the orange envelope and let the tooth drop into the shoebox.\n\n39\n00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:06,159\n\"Put it under your pillow tonight,\" she told the man, \"and there will be money there tomorrow.\"\n\n40\n00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:17,820\nAt first the man looked surprised. Then he smiled warmly and waved goodbye to Marissa as she and her mother walked away.\n\n41\n00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:23,240\nNow, all he needed was a pillow.\n\n42\n00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:41,240\nI used to read books to my kids all the time. They're too big now, but I hope you have a chance to talk to your teachers or maybe your mom or your dad about the book.\n\n43\n00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:51,500\nI think it's a really thoughtful book. Starts out being a trip to the dentist and it ends with a little girl meeting a homeless man.\n\n44\n00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,240\nAnyway, I hope you liked it, I did.",

The recipe for a tomato-and-veggie filled soup.\n\n45\n00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,400\nHe was sure the tomatoes would make it look bloody and gloopy, just like a zombie dish.\n\n46\n00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,940\nHis parents were going to devour it!\n\n47\n00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,000\nMo chopped and diced,\n\n48\n00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,940\nblended and pureed,\n\n49\n00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680\nperfected and poured.\n\n50\n00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:31,720\nFinally, the soup was finished.\n\n51\n00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,580\nMo carefully shuffled it over to the house for dinner...\n\n52\n00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:41,480\n...where he found a feast fit for a zombie.\n\n53\n00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,480\nMo! You're just in time.\n\n54\n00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,280\nTry some arm-panadas, mi amor. Prime cuts!\n\n55\n00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,540\nMira, I made spicy man-naise.\n\n56\n00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,600\nI made something for you to try too. It's called blood bile bisque.\n\n57\n00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,740\nBone Appétit gave it five brains.\n\n58\n00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,020\nSmells strange. Looks delightful!\n\n59\n00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,960\nCinco brains! Must be delicioso!\n\n60\n00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,400\nThey dug in.\n\n61\n00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,700\nMo closed his eyes and sucked in his breath. This was it.\n\n62\n00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,760\nThey'd savor the soup. They'd ask for más.\n\n63\n00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,440\nMo imagined breakfasts, lunches, dinners, snacks. All VEGETABLES!\n\n64\n00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,900\nRaw, cooked, steamed, and fried. Forever and ever.\n\n65\n00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,620\nHe saw all his dreams coming true.\n\n66\n00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,060\nUntil...\n\n67\n00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,000\nMo's parents did not like the soup.\n\n68\n00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,880\nNot. One. Bit.\n\n69\n00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:59,280\n¡Dios mío! This soup tastes like... like... vegetables!\n\n70\n00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,300\nYuck!\n\n71\n00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,400\nMo's heart sank to his toes. His plan was a bust.\n\n72\n00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:19,900\nHow many times do we have to tell you that zombies don't eat veggies?!\n\n73\n00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,460\nMaybe other zombies don't eat vegetables, but I do.\n\n74\n00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,300\nMom and dad, I'm different.\n\n75\n00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,860\nBut I'm still me. Mauricio Romero.\n\n76\n00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,240\nYour niño.\n\n77\n00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,060\nYour Mo.\n\n78\n00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,560\nMo reminded his parents that he liked chasing humans as they ran in marathons.\n\n79\n00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,280\nAnd he promised he'd always cheer for Dad during championship brain-eating competitions.\n\n80\n00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,240\nHe also loved doing the zombie shuffle under the moonlight with Mom.\n\n81\n00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,720\nHe was a zombie. A Romero.\n\n82\n00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,580\nHe just liked to eat vegetables.\n\n83\n00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,780\nMo's parents loved their son and finally accepted that it was okay to be different.\n\n84\n00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,500\nThey even promised Mo they would eat more veggies— for him.\n\n85\n00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,900\nBut only a teeny, tiny bit.\n\n86\n00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,340\nThe Romeros knew that most zombies don't eat veggies.\n\n87\n00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,000\nBut they were more than zombies.\n\n88\n00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,820\nThey were a family.\n\n89\n00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,720\nThe end.\n\n90\n00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,640\nI love this story for many reasons. First of all, it is perfectly fine to be different,\n\n91\n00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,780\nbecause in a loving family, you'll be accepted.\n\n92\n00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,900\nAnd it's okay to express yourself.\n\n93\n00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,600\nAnd as Mo showed us, he was very respectful of his parents,\n\n94\n00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,440\nand they were able to come together and compromise and share respect for each other.\n\n95\n00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,520\nSo don't ever forget kids, be true to yourself, be honest, express yourself,\n\n96\n00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,800\nand don't be afraid to be authentic.\n\n97\n00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,420\nThank you for watching Storyline Online.
