00:04:24,840\nDropping the coal, Georgie rapped his knuckles\non the door and ran back to Papa.\n\n105\n00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,560\nThey hid behind some bushes.\n\n106\n00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,080\nAfter a moment, Mrs. Kolbach opened the door.\n\n107\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479\nWhen she spied the coal, she lifted it up.\n\n108\n00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,419\nholding it to her chest and cried, \"God bless\nyou!\"\n\n109\n00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,810\nGeogie's heart felt so warm it sent tingles\nright down to his toes.\n\n110\n00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,060\n\"Who else,

piled chunks of coal in his arms.\n\n116\n00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,310\n\"Thank you,\" the boy said.\n\n117\n00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,199\n\"we've been freezing all winter.\"\n\n118\n00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,789\nHe shivered in the thin shirt that he wore.\n\n119\n00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,720\nGeorgie hesitated, then took off his coat.\n\n120\n00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,360\n\"Here, take this.\n\n121\n00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,000\nIt's too small for me anyway.\"\n\n122\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,849\nThe boy's eyes grew wide.\n\n123\n00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,569\n\"You mean

--> 00:05:26,240\nBy the time they got home, Georgie was covered\ncoal dust from elbow to ears, and there was\n\n127\n00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,250\nonly one chunk of coal left.\n\n128\n00:05:28,250

notice you gave away your\ngood coat.\"\n\n131\n00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,960\nThey reached the porch.\n\n132\n00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,100\nGeorgie climbed the steps, but Papa turned\nto go.\n\n133\n00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,750\n\"Aren't you coming in, Papa?\"\n\n134\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,759\n\"I still have a days work to do, son.\n\n135\n00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,830\nRun

--> 00:05:57,300\n\"I love you Papa.\"\n\n139\n00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,569\nPapa patted Georgie on the head.\n\n140\n00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,770\n\"I love you too, little coal
