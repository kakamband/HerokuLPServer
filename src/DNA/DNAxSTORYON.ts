00:02:26,959\n\"Isn't that stealing?\"\n60\n00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,980\nHarley scowled at him.\n61\n00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,070\n\"Ain't you tired of being cold every morning?\"\n62\n00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,590\n\"Yes, but--\" \"Don't be a chicken, Georgie,\nor I'll tell on you and say it was your idea.\"\n63\n00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,799\nGeorgie slowly climbed over the top and landed\non hard lumps.\n64\n00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,060\nHe pick one up and tossed it over.\n65\n00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,909\nHarley caught it and it on the ground.\n66\n00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,670\n\"Another,\" he said.\n67\n00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,030\nGeorgie grabbed two lumps and dropped them\ndown.\n68\n00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,189\nHarley grinned up at

pieces faster and\nfaster.\n72\n00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,790\nSuddenly the train gave a jerk.\n73\n00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,790\nGeorgie fell backward.\n74\n00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,319\n\"Georgie,

began to pick up speed.\n78\n00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,600\n\"Help me, Harley!\" Geogie shouted.\n79\n00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,670\nHe tried to push off the coal, but he just\nsank deeper into the pile.\n80\n00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,340\nThen papa's head appeard over the top of the\nrailcar.\n81\n00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,390\n\"Time to go, Georgie\" Papa reached out his\nhand and pulled Georgie free.\n82\n00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,280\nThey sat on the edge of the railcar.\n83\n00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,480\nWhen Papa said jump, Georgie jumped.\n84\n00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,170\nPapa helped Georgie to his feet.\n85\n00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,460\n\"If I hadn't seen you boys head this way,\nyou'd be half way to Texas by now.\"\n86\n00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:39,780\nGeorgie craned his neck, looking for Harley,\nbut his friend had turned tail and run.\n87\n00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,370\n\"Sorry, Papa.\"\n88\n00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,689\n\"You know stealing's wrong?\"\n89\n00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,269\nPapa said sternly.\n90\n00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,959\nGeorgie nodded, feeling the shame curl his\ntoes.\n91\n00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,899\nThey walked back to the little mountain of\ncoal.\n92\n00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,000\nPapa scratched his head.\n93\n00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,659\n\"Train's gone now.\n94\n00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,680\nWe can't give back the coal.\n95\n00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,799\nBut I've got an idea what to do with it.\n96\n00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,209\nHelp me load it.\"\n97\n00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,370\nThey rolled the wheelbarrow down the street\nto a house with a sagging front porch.\n98\n00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,799\n\"This is widow Kolbach's house,\" Georgie said.\n99\n00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,870\nPapa handed him two large chunks of coal.\n100\n00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,819\n\"Leave this by her door.\n101\n00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,799\nThen knock twice and run on back here.\"\n102\n00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,959\nGeorgie climbed the steps.\n103\n00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,630\nThe porch creaked under his weight.\n104\n00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,840\nDropping the coal, Georgie rapped his knuckles\non the door and ran back to Papa.\n105\n00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,560\nThey hid behind some bushes.\n106\n00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,080\nAfter a moment, Mrs. Kolbach opened the door.\n107\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479\nWhen she spied the coal, she lifted it up.\n108\n00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,419\nholding it to her chest and cried, \"God bless\nyou!\"\n109\n00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,810\nGeogie's heart felt so warm it sent tingles\nright down to his toes.\n110\n00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,060\n\"Who else, Papa?\"\n111\n00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,090\n\"Come on, the Children's Home is just down\nthe road.\"\n112\n00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,460\nThey trundled the cart to a large brick house.\n113\n00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,780\nKids ran about in the yard.\n114\n00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,740\nOne of the boys came over to the fence.\n115\n00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,900\nGeorgie piled chunks of coal in his arms.\n116\n00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,310\n\"Thank you,\" the boy said.\n117\n00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,199\n\"we've been freezing all winter.\"\n118\n00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,789\nHe shivered in the thin shirt that he wore.\n119\n00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,720\nGeorgie hesitated, then took off his coat.\n120\n00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,360\n\"Here, take this.\n121\n00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,000\nIt's too small for me anyway.\"\n122\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,849\nThe boy's eyes grew wide.\n123\n00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,569\n\"You mean it?\"\n124\n00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,029\nGeorgie nodded, piling the coat on top of\nthe boy's arms.\n125\n00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,880\nPapa had many more stops to make.\n126\n00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:26,240\nBy the time they got home, Georgie was covered\ncoal dust from elbow to ears, and there was\n127\n00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,250\nonly one chunk of coal left.\n128\n00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,639\n\"Who are we giving this last piece to?\"\n129\n00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,789\n\"That's for your mother,\" Papa winked.\n130\n00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:36,930\n\"Maybe she won't notice you gave away your\ngood coat.\"\n131\n00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,960\nThey reached the porch.\n132\n00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,100\nGeorgie climbed the steps, but Papa turned\nto go.\n133\n00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,750\n\"Aren't you coming in, Papa?\"\n134\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,759\n\"I still have a days work to do, son.\n135\n00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,830\nRun along now.\"\n136\n00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,830\nGeorgie hesitated.\n137\n00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,870\nThen he ran down the steps and threw his arms\naround Papa's waist.\n138\n00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,300\n\"I love you Papa.\"\n139\n00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,569\nPapa patted Georgie on the head.\n140\n00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,770\n\"I love you too, little coal thief.\"\n141\n00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,310\nThe end.\n142\n00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,620\nWow.\n143\n00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,389\nWhat a great story.\n144\n00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,550\nIt really got me at the end there.\n145\n00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,960\nI think that's definitely one of the things\nthat I love about reading.\n146\n00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,120\nThat you can really just get absorbed and\nlost and really put yourself in another person's shoes.\n147\n00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,509\nYou know, when ever a book does something\nlike that for me I think it's an extraordinary\n148\n00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,620\nand wonderful experience.\n149\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,870\nI'm grateful I got the opportunity to read\nand read it to you.\n",
