		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:11,600\nHello! Welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:20,580\nMy name is Ernest Borgnine and we're going to be reading a book today called \"The Rainbow Fish\" by Marcus Pfister.\n\n3\n00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,500\nAll right. Here we go.\n\n4\n00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,640\nA long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish.\n\n5\n00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:40,920\nNot just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean.\n\n6\n00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:50,760\nHis scales were every shade of blue and green and purple, with sparkling silver scales among them.\n\n7\n00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,100\nOh, beautiful.\n\n8\n00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,780\nThe other fish were amazed at his beauty. They called him Rainbow Fish.\n\n9\n00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,550\n\"Come on, Rainbow Fish,\" they would call.\n\n10\n00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,690\n\"Come and play with us!\"\n\n11\n00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:15,940\nBut the Rainbow Fish would just glide past, proud and silent, letting his scales shimmer.\n\n12\n00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:25,620\nOne day, a little blue fish followed after him. \"Rainbow Fish,\" he called,\n\n13\n00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:35,440\n\"Wait for me! Please give me one of your shiny scales. They are so wonderful and you have so many.\"\n\n14\n00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,790\n\"You want me to give you one of my special scales? Who do you think you are?\" cried the Rainbow Fish.\n\n15\n00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:44,520\n\"Get away from me!\"\n\n16\n00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,950\nShocked, the little blue fish swam away.\n\n17\n00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:53,050\nHe was so upset, he told all his friends of what had happened.\n\n18\n00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:59,049\nFrom then on, no one would have anything to do with the Rainbow Fish.\n\n19\n00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:03,000\nThey turned away when he swam by.\n\n20\n00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:14,420\nWhat good were the dazzling, shimmering scales with no one to admire them?\n\n21\n00:02:14,429 --> 00:02:20,259\nNow he was the loneliest fish in the entire ocean.\n\n22\n00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:25,309\nOne day, he poured out his troubles to the starfish.\n\n23\n00:02:25,309 --> 00:02:30,339\n\"I really am beautiful, why doesn't anybody like me?\"\n\n24\n00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,500\n\"I can't answer that for you,\" said the starfish. \"But if you go beyond the coral reef\n\n25\n00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:45,580\nto a deep cave, you will find the wise octopus. Maybe she can help you.\"\n\n26\n00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:52,840\nThe Rainbow Fish found the cave. It was very dark inside and he couldn't see anything.\n\n27\n00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,789\nAnd then suddenly two eyes caught him in their glare and the octopus emerged from the darkness.\n\n28\n00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:07,340\n\"I have been waiting for you,\" said the octopus with a deep voice.\n\n29\n00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:14,320\n\"The waves have told me your story. This is my advice.\n\n30\n00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:24,280\nGive a glittering scale to each of the other fish. You will no longer be the most beautiful fish in the sea,\n\n31\n00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,580\nbut you will discover how to be happy.\n\n32\n00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:37,520\n\"I, I can't... \" the Rainbow Fish started to say, but the octopus had already disappeared into a dark cloud of ink.\n\n33\n00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,840\nGive away my scales? My beautiful, shining scales? Never.\n\n34\n00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,080\nHow could I ever be happy without them?\n\n35\n00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:57,689\nSuddenly, he felt the light touch of a fin. The little blue fish was back!\n\n36\n00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:04,939\n\"Rainbow Fish, please, don't be angry. I just want one little scale.\"\n\n37\n00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:16,500\nThe Rainbow Fish wavered. Only one very very small shimmery scale, he thought.\n\n38\n00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,200\nWell, maybe I wouldn't miss just one.\n\n39\n00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,220\nCarefully, the Rainbow Fish pulled out the smallest scale and gave it to the little fish.\n\n40\n00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,840\n\"Oh, thank you! Thank you very much!\" the little blue fish bubbled playfully\n\n41\n00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,220\nas he tucked the shiny scale among his blue ones.\n\n42\n00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,300\nA rather peculiar feeling came over the Rainbow Fish.\n\n43\n00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:54,300\nFor a long time, he watched the little blue fish swim back and forth with his new scale glittering in the water.\n\n44\n00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,440\nThe little blue fish whizzed through the ocean with his scale flashing,\n\n45\n00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:04,389\nso it didn't take long before the Rainbow Fish was surrounded by the other fish.\n\n46\n00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,079\nEveryone wanted a glittering scale.\n\n47\n00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:17,569\nThe Rainbow Fish shared his scales left and right. And the more he gave away, the more delighted he became.\n\n48\n00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:27,580\nWhen the water around him filled with glimmering scales, he at last felt at home among the other fish.\n\n49\n00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,960\nFinally the Rainbow Fish had only one shining scale left.\n\n50\n00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:43,240\nHis most prized possessions had been given away, and yet he was very happy.\n\n51\n00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,180\n\"Come on, Rainbow Fish,\" they called, \"Come and play with us!\"\n\n52\n00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,300\n\"Here I come!\" said the Rainbow Fish\n\n53\n00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:58,020\nand, happy as a splash, he swam off to join his friends.\n\n54\n00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:14,580\nThat wonderful? That's called \"The Rainbow Fish,\" by Marcus Pfister, okay.",

You’re making me crazy!”\n\n24\n00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,960\nOne day, Clark asked Mrs. Inkydink, “What’s wrong with everyone?”\n\n25\n00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,360\nMrs. Inkydink patted his fin.\n\n26\n00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:13,080\n“Clark, sometimes you play too hard, you munch too hard, and —gosh— you even help too hard.”\n\n27\n00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,360\n“But life is SO exciting!” said Clark.\n\n28\n00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,240\n“There’s a time and a place for everything,” said Mrs. Inkydink.\n\n29\n00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,580\n“And sometimes the rule is stay cool.”\n\n30\n00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,360\nAt recess, Clark tried to stay cool, but he pushed the swing with too much zing!\n\n31\n00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,380\n“Sorry,” said Clark. “I forgot.”\n\n32\n00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,540\n“Yikes!” cried Joey Mackerel.\n\n33\n00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,880\nAt lunch, Clark tried to stay cool, but everything smelled so good that he munched a bunch of lunches.\n\n34\n00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,700\n“Sorry,” said Clark. “I forgot.”\n“We’re STARVING!” said his friends.\n\n35\n00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,000\nIn class, Clark tried to stay cool, but a good book got him all shook up.\n\n36\n00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,880\n“Now, Clark!” said Mrs. Inkydink. “This isn’t the time or the place. Tell me, what’s the rule?”\n\n37\n00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,020\n“Stay cool,” said Clark.\n“Hey, that rhymes!” he cried.\n\n38\n00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,060\nThen Clark got a big idea in his sharky head.\n\n39\n00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,800\nMaybe if I make a rhyme, I’ll remember every time! he thought.\n\n40\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,800\nThe next day, he put his plan to work.\n\n41\n00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800\nIn class, when lessons got exciting, Clark wanted to bounce up out of his seat.\n\n42\n00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,800\nInstead, he told himself: “When teacher’s talking, don’t go walking.”\n\n43\n00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,620\nAnd what do you know? It worked!\n\n44\n00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,300\n“Attaboy, Clark!” said Mrs. Inkydink. Clark smiled. “Lessons are fun!”\n\n45\n00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,020\nAt lunch, everything smelled sooo yummy.\n\n46\n00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,300\nWhen Clark wanted to eat and eat and never stop, he told himself: “Only munch your own lunch.”\n\n47\n00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,040\nAnd it worked again!\n“Way to go, Clark!” said his friends.\n\n48\n00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,760\nClark grinned. “Lunch is fun.”\n\n49\n00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,340\nAt playtime, Clark told himself: “Easy does it, that’s the way.\n\n50\n00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,100\n“Then my friends will let me play.”\n\n51\n00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,200\nAnd playtime was fun. Once more, Clark loved his life.\n\n52\n00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,100\nBut then a shadow fell across the playground—\n\n53\n00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,640\na gi-normous shadow with tentacles galore.\n\n54\n00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,640\n“It’s a new kid, and he looks scary!” cried Joey Mackerel. “Swim for your lives!”\n\n55\n00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,500\nThe squid squashed the slide, and it snapped off the swings.\n\n56\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,860\n“Oops. My bad,” said the new kid.\n\n57\n00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,760\n“Wait,” said Clark. “He just wants to play. Let’s find a way!”\n\n58\n00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,440\nAnd he swam at the new kid with all his might.\n\n59\n00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,900\nClark played harder than he ever had before— \nupsy-downsy and spinna-ma-jig.\n\n60\n00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,880\nWhy, he even made up a new game: tail-whump-a-lumpus!\n\n61\n00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,120\n“Wow, that was fun,” said the new kid breathlessly, and he settled down.\n\n62\n00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,500\n“If you want to come to school, you’ve got to stay cool,” said Clark.\n\n63\n00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,280\n“That’s right, Clark,” said Mrs. Inkydink.\n\n64\n00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,880\n“And thanks for taking care of our new classmate, Sid the Squid.”\n\n65\n00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,000\n“Hooray for Clark the Shark!” everyone cheered.\n\n66\n00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,600\nThat night Clark’s mother asked, “What did you learn at school, dear?”\n\n67\n00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,340\n“There’s a time and a place for everything,” Clark said.\n\n68\n00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,000\n“Sometimes you stay cool.”\n\n69\n00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,680\n“But sometimes a shark’s gotta do what a shark’s gotta do.”\n\n70\n00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,260\nThe end.\n\n71\n00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,340\nThat was Clark the Shark everybody.\n\n72\n00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,060\nI think it speaks to all of us.\n\n73\n00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,080\nIt talks about how we all want to do what we want to do , right?\n\n74\n00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,060\nWe want to be ourselves.\n\n75\n00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360\nand we want to yell when we want to yell and play and laugh and have a good time.\n\n76\n00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,580\nBut as Mrs. Inkydink said, there's a time and a place for everything.\n\n77\n00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,660\nAnd there is a time and a place to be considerate of other people's feelings.\n\n78\n00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,900\nI think the lesson is: Be considerate.\n\n79\n00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,860\nThank you so much for watching Storyline Online.\n\n80\n00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,780\nMake sure to check out all of the other stories.\n\n81\n00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,780\nKeep watching and keep reading.\n\n82\n00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,260\nyou",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:16,980\nHello, I'm Robert Guillaume and welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,500\nToday we're going to be reading a story by Chih-Yuan Chen called Guji Guji.\n\n3\n00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,400\nAn egg was rolling on the ground.\n\n4\n00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:32,540\nIt rolled through the trees.\n\n5\n00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,030\nIt rolled across the meadow.\n\n6\n00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,640\nIt rolled all the way down the hill.\n\n7\n00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,870\nFinally, it rolled right into a \nduck's nest.\n\n8\n00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:50,120\nMother Duck didn't notice. (She was reading.)\n\n9\n00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,900\nSoon enough, the eggs began to crack.\n\n10\n00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:03,930\nThe first duckling to hatch had blue spots. Mother Duck called him Crayon.\n\n11\n00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,320\nThe second duckling had brown stripes. \"Zebra,\" Mother Duck decided.\n\n12\n00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,680\nThe third duckling was yellow, and Mother Duck named him Moonlight.\n\n13\n00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,730\nA rather odd-looking duckling hatched from the fourth egg.\n\n14\n00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,520\n\"Guji Guji,\" he said, and that became his name.\n\n15\n00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:39,700\nMother Duck taught her four ducklings how to swim, how to dive and how to waddle.\n\n16\n00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:49,140\nGuji Guji always learned more quickly than the others, He was bigger and stronger, too.\n\n17\n00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:57,260\nBut no matter how quick they were, or what they looked like, Mother Duck loved all her ducklings the same.\n\n18\n00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:09,820\nThen one terrible day, three crocodiles came out of the lake. They looked a lot like Guji Guji.\n\n19\n00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:23,139\nThe crocodiles were smiling, and when they laughed with their mouths wide open, the whole world could see their big, pointed teeth.\n\n20\n00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,080\nThe three crocodiles saw Guji Guji and smiled some more.\n\n21\n00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,620\n\"Look at that ridiculous crocodile. He's walking like a duck!\"\n\n22\n00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:42,760\nGuji Guji heard them. \"I am not walking like a duck, I am a duck!\" he explained.\n\n23\n00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:52,979\nThe crocodiles laughed. \"Look at yourself! No feathers, no beak, no big webbed feet!\n\n24\n00:02:52,979 --> 00:03:05,599\nWhat you have is blue-gray skin, sharp claws, pointed teeth and the smell of bad crocodile. You're just like us.\"\n\n25\n00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:17,909\nThe first crocodile said, \"Your blue-gray body lets you hide under water without being seen so you can get close to fat, delicious ducks.\"\n\n26\n00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:28,379\nThe second crocodile said, \"Big, sharp claws help you hold fat, delicious ducks tightly so they don't get away.\"\n\n27\n00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:39,589\nThe third crocodile said, \"Pointed teeth are necessary so you can chew fat, delicious ducks. Mmmm. Yum.\"\n\n28\n00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:45,319\nThe three crocodiles grinned. \"We know you live with the ducks.\n\n29\n00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:53,489\nTake them to the bridge tomorrow and practice diving. We'll wait underneath with our mouths open wide.\"\n\n30\n00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:59,460\n\"Why would I do that?\" Guji Guji asked. \"Why should I listen to you?\"\n\n31\n00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:05,800\n\"Because we are all crocodiles, and crocodiles help each other.\"\n\n32\n00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,100\nThe bad crocodiles grinned again and vanished into the grass.\n\n33\n00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,600\nGuji Guji felt terrible. He sat by the lake to think.\n\n34\n00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,580\n\"Is it true? Am I a bad crocodile too?\"\n\n35\n00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,889\nHe looked down into the lake and a made a fierce face.\n\n36\n00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:39,900\nGuji Guji laughed. He looked ridiculous. \"I am not a bad crocodile. Of course, I'm not exactly a duck either.\"\n\n37\n00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:51,280\n\"But the three crocodiles are nasty, and they want to eat my family. I must think of a way to stop them.\"\n\n38\n00:04:52,300 --> 00:05:01,920\nGuji Guji thought and thought until finally he thought up a good idea. He went home happy and content.\n\n39\n00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:12,699\nThat night, the three bad crocodiles sharpened their pointed teeth, all the while thinking of fat, delicious ducks.\n\n40\n00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:16,279\nThey were ready for their feast.\n\n41\n00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:24,819\nThe next day, Guji Guji did as he'd been told-- he took the flock of ducks to the bridge to practice diving.\n\n42\n00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:30,689\nThe three bad crocodiles were waiting for the ducks underneath the bridge.\n\n43\n00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:36,820\nIt wasn't fat, delicious ducks that dropped from the bridge though;\n\n44\n00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:43,280\nit was three big, hard rocks! The crocodiles bit down.\n\n45\n00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,660\n\"Crack! Crack! Crack!\" went their pointed teeth.\n\n46\n00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:57,269\nThe three bad crocodiles ran as fast as they could. In barely a minute, they were nowhere to be seen!\n\n47\n00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:05,040\nGuji Guji had saved the ducks! Guji Guji was the duck hero of the day!\n\n48\n00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,100\nThat night, all the ducks danced and celebrated.\n\n49\n00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,540\nGuji Guji continued to live with Mother Duck, Crayon, Zebra and Moonlight,\n\n50\n00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:25,300\nand every day he became a stronger and happier \"crocoduck.\"\n\n51\n00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,880\nThe end.",

He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped.\n\n24\n00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,440\nHe rolled over and played dead.\n\n25\n00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480\nHe danced and he sang.\n\n26\n00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,740\nHe did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said,\n\n27\n00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,360\n\"Oh no, it couldn't be Harry.\"\n\n28\n00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,400\nHarry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped.\n\n29\n00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,240\nHe ran to a corner of the garden and started to dig furiously.\n\n30\n00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,640\nSoon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks.\n\n31\n00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,940\nHe'd found the scrubbing brush!\n\n32\n00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,580\nAnd carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house.\n\n33\n00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,560\nUp the stairs he dashed, \nwith the family following close behind.\n\n34\n00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:14,749\nHe jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth,\n\n35\n00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:17,680\na trick he certainly had never done before.\n\n36\n00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,700\n\"This little doggy wants a bath!\" cried the little girl,\n\n37\n00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,680\nand her father said, \"Why don't you and your brother give him one?\"\n\n38\n00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,140\nHarry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had.

Almost.\n\n124\n00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,459\nMiss Merriweather's left arm was in a cast.\n\n125\n00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,739\nThe doctor had told her not to work too hard.\n\n126\n00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,269\n\"I will have my lion to help me,\" Miss Merriweather thought.\n\n127\n00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,120\nBut the lion did not come to the library that morning.\n\n128\n00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:39,319\nAt three o'clock, Miss Merriweather walked over to the story corner.\n\n129\n00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:43,139\nThe story lady was just beginning a story for the children.\n\n130\n00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,120\nThe lion was not there.\n\n131\n00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,000\nPeople in the library kept looking up from their books and computer screens,\n\n132\n00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000\nhoping they would see a familiar furry face.\n\n133\n00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,269\nBut the lion did not come that day.\n\n134\n00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:02,600\nThe lion did not come the next day, either.  Or the day after that.\n\n135\n00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,209\nOne evening, Mr. McBee stopped by\nMiss Merriweather's office on his way out.\n\n136\n00:09:08,209 --> 00:09:13,200\n\"Can I do anything for you before I go, Miss Merriweather?\" he asked her.\n\n137\n00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,700\n\"No, thank you,\" said Miss Merriweather.\n\n138\n00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,000\nShe was looking out the window.\n\n139\n00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,700\nHer voice was very quiet. Even for the library.\n\n140\n00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,700\nMr. McBee frowned as he walked away.\n\n141\n00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,900\nHe thought there was probably something\nhe could do for Miss Merriweather, after all.\n\n142\n00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,100\nMr. McBee left the library.\n\n143\n00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,600\nBut he did not go home.\n\n144\n00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,300\nHe walked around the neighborhood.\n\n145\n00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,300\nHe looked under cars.  He looked behind bushes.\n\n146\n00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,400\nHe looked in backyards and trash cans and tree houses.\n\n147\n00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,580\nFinally he circled all the way back to the library.\n\n148\n00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,100\nThe lion was sitting outside, looking in through the glass doors.\n\n149\n00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,690\n\"Hello, Lion,\" said Mr. McBee.\n\n150\n00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,780\nThe lion did not turn around.\n\n151\n00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,880\n\"I thought you might like to know,\" said Mr. McBee,\n\n152\n00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,400\n\"that there's a new rule at the library.\n\n153\n00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:17,070\nNo roaring allowed, unless you have a very good reason -\n\n154\n00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,000\nsay, if you're trying to help a friend who's been hurt, for example.\"\n\n155\n00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,990\nThe lion's ears twitched.\n\n156\n00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,900\nHe turned around.  But Mr. McBee was already walking away.\n\n157\n00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,390\nThe next day, Mr. McBee walked down the hall to Miss Merriweather's office.\n\n158\n00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:42,760\n\"What is it, Mr. McBee?\" asked Miss Merriweather\nin her new, sad, quiet voice.\n\n159\n00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,200\n\"I thought you might like to know,\" said Mr. McBee,\n\n160\n00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,490\n\"that there's a lion.  In the library.\"\n\n161\n00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,589\nMiss Merriweather jumped up from her chair and ran down the hall.\n\n162\n00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:59,400\nMr. McBee smiled. \"No running!\" he called after her.\n\n163\n00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,400\nMiss Merriweather didn't listen.\n\n164\n00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,400\nSometimes there was a good reason to break the rules.  Even in the library.\n\n165\n00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,370\nI love this book!\n\n166\n00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,130\nAnd there are so many other books just like this\n\n167\n00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,300\nand other types of stories with other kinds animals in the library\n\n168\n00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,990\nand it's so easy\n\n169\n00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,200\nto just go there and check out a book\nor read a book in the library\n\n170\n00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,200\nand they even have people that will tell stories\nso check that out\n\n171\n00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:45,550\nWell, hopefully, I'll see you in the library someday.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,629\nHello, I'm Elijah Wood. Welcome to the SAG Foundation Storyline.\n\n2\n00:00:08,629 --> 00:00:18,340\nI'll be reading a story today called \"Me and My Cat,\" by Satoshi Kitamura, both illustrated and written by, so let's get into it.\n\n3\n00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,800\nLate one night an old lady in a pointed hat came in through my bedroom window.\n\n4\n00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,940\nShe brandished her broom at me and fired out some words. Then she left without saying goodbye...\n\n5\n00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,510\n\"Nicholas, wake up! You'll be late for school.\"\n\n6\n00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,910\nIt must be mom. It must be morning again.\n\n7\n00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:48,080\nMom dragged me to the bathroom and made me wash and dress. Downstairs she interrupted my breakfast. She was furious.\n\n8\n00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,360\nShe carried me off to catch the school bus. I had gone... but I was still here...\n\n9\n00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,700\n\"How strange,\" I thought to myself, pulling my whiskers.\n\n10\n00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,480\nWHISKERS?!\n\n11\n00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:08,080\nI rushed to the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror. Leonardo, my cat, was staring back at me.\n\n12\n00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,260\nBut it wasn't him inside.\n\n13\n00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,240\nIt was me, Nicholas! I couldn't believe my eyes.\n\n14\n00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,850\nI had turned into a cat!\n\n15\n00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:22,620\n\"Don't panic,\" I told myself. I sat in the armchair to consider the situation carefully...\n\n16\n00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,100\nI fell asleep. When I woke up, I felt a little better.\n\n17\n00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:31,960\nMaybe it wasn't such a bad thing to be a cat. I didn't have to go to school, did I?\n\n18\n00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:39,049\nI hopped onto the table, and from there to the top of the shelves. What fun! I could never do this before.\n\n19\n00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:47,140\nI decided to leap toward the cupboard on the other side of the room. Ready, set...  oops.\n\n20\n00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,740\nMom threw me out of the house.\n\n21\n00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:57,840\nWhile I was rambling in the garden, Gioconda, the next-door-neighbor cat, came up and licked me all over my face. Yuck!\n\n22\n00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,340\n\"Time to go for a walk,\" I thought.\n\n23\n00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:08,780\nThe brick wall was warm under my paws. As I got close to Miss Thomson's garden, a funny thought occurred to me.\n\n24\n00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:16,620\nMiss Thomson had given me Leonardo when he was a kitten. Leonardo was Heloise's son.\n\n25\n00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,760\nDid that mean Heloise was now my mother?\n\n26\n00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,900\n\"Miaow, Miam (Hello, Mom),\" I called tentatively. She ignored me completely.\n\n27\n00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:31,849\nFarther along, I came across three mean-looking cats.\n\n28\n00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,240\n\"Excuse me. May I go through?\" I said.\n\n29\n00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,760\n\"No, go away! It's our wall,\" replied one.\n\n30\n00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,640\n\"I think the wall belongs to every--\"\nBut before I could finish my sentence they were all over me.\n\n31\n00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,940\nWe punched and kicked and scratched one another until we fell off the wall, entangled.\n\n32\n00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:56,449\n\"Bowwowowowowowowow!\" A dog came running toward us, barking furiously. The cats ran away in all directions.\n\n33\n00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:02,579\nIt was Bernard, Mr. Stone's dog. He's a sweet dog, my favorite in the neighborhood.\n\n34\n00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,180\n\"Thanks, Bernard. You came just in time.\"  \nBut he chased me out of the garden.\n\n35\n00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,120\nOf course! He couldn't recognize me.\n\n36\n00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,080\nSo this was the world that Leonardo lived in. Life was as tough and complicated as it was for humans.\n\n37\n00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,200\nWhen I got home, I went into the house. Then I heard a scratching noise coming from the front door.\n\n38\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,600\nIt was \"me\" back from school, trying to get in through the cat flap.\n\n39\n00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,840\nBut was he me, \"Nicholas\"? Or was he poor little Leonardo inside my body?\n\n40\n00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,920\nOnce indoors, he continued to behave strangely.\n\n41\n00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:44,440\nHe scratched himself earnestly, and when that was done, he challenged his shoes until they surrendered.\n\n42\n00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,620\nHe licked his sweater clean, then spent a long time sharpening his nails.\n\n43\n00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,100\nHe found the goldfish particularly fascinating.\n\n44\n00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,220\nHe tried to sort the washing, and then the yarn... but at last he gave up.\n\n45\n00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,969\nHe found the radiator and the litter box irresistible.  But he didn't seen to like me at all.\n\n46\n00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:09,980\nAt last, Mom saw something was wrong with her son. She became so worried that she called the doctor and asked him to come at once.\n\n47\n00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,650\n\"Nothing to worry about,\" said Dr. Wire. \"He's just a little overtired. Send him to bed early and he'll be fine in the morning.\"\n\n48\n00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:26,349\nMom was still very upset.  She held him tight in her arms all evening.  I felt sorry for them both.\n\n49\n00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:35,060\nI climbed on Leonardo-in-my-shape and stroked his cheek. He purred. Then Mom stroked me gently. I purred.\n\n50\n00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,409\nLater that night, the old lady in the pointed hat came in through my bedroom window.\n\n51\n00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,780\n\"Sorry, love. I got the wrong address,\" she said.\n\n52\n00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,500\nShe brandished her broom and blurted out some words. Then she left without saying good night.\n\n53\n00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,620\n\"Nicholas, wake up! You'll be late for school,\" I heard Mom shouting.\n\n54\n00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,080\nEverything was back to normal.\n\n55\n00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,340\nAt school Mr. McGough sat on the table.\n\n56\n00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,460\nHe scratched himself, licked his shirt, and fell asleep for the rest of the lesson.\n\n57\n00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,080\nWell that's the end of our story.  It's been very enjoyable to sit here and read to you.\n\n58\n00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:20,949\nIf you'd like to rent this book from a library, then go to your local library and get this book and maybe you can read along with me.\n\n59\n00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:26,780\nYou can click on me and I'll read you the story and you can read the book with me. It should be quite enjoyable.\n\n60\n00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,120\nThank you very much.",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,020\nHello there. Welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:12,740\nI'm Ty Burrell, and today I'll be reading \"Mice Twice,\"\n\n3\n00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,100\nwritten and illustrated by Joseph Low.\n\n4\n00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,120\nCat was thinking about supper.\n\n5\n00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,860\nHe thought, \"I could eat forty-seven grasshoppers.\nOr I could eat sixty-nine crickets.\n\n6\n00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,820\nOr I could eat a fine, fat sparrow.\n\n7\n00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,800\nBut what I think I'd really like is a nice, tender mouse.\"\n\n8\n00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,040\nSo he went outside and sat at Mouse's door.\n\n9\n00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,620\n\"Are you there, Mouse,\" he asked, \"and in good health, I hope?\"\n\n10\n00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,540\nMouse lay snug in her nest behind the door. The door was too small for Cat to get through.\n\n11\n00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,080\n\"Never better,\" she said.\n\n12\n00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,420\nCat tuned his rough voice to make it smooth.\n\n13\n00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:08,820\nHe said, \"Such a lovely day! I was just thinking,\n'How nice to have a friend for supper.'\nI do hope you can join me this evening.\"\n\n14\n00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:15,740\nMouse knew Cat well, and all his cunning ways.\n\"May I bring a friend?\" she asked.\n\n15\n00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:25,000\n(\"Mice twice!\" thought Cat, licking his whiskers.)\n\"By all means,\" he said. \"Shall we say six o'clock?\"\n\n16\n00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,440\n\"Six will be fine,\" said Mouse.\n\n17\n00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,980\nAt six that evening she knocked on Cat's door. Cat's stomach rumbled.\n\n18\n00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:41,980\n\"Come in, come in!\" he said.\nBut when he opened the door, he saw that Mouse's friend was not another mouse.\n\n19\n00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,520\nIt was Dog. Dog was grinning.\nHe was twice as big as Cat.\n\n20\n00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,760\nCat was angry, but he was afraid to show it.\n\n21\n00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,840\nHe waved them into the house. On the table were two small bits of cheese.\n\n22\n00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,700\n\"Such a warm day!\" said Cat. \"I find it best not to eat on warm days. But do help yourselves.\"\n\n23\n00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,040\nSo Mouse took one piece of cheese.\nAnd Dog took the other.\n\n24\n00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:18,240\nWhen he had swallowed his, Dog said, \"I have seldom enjoyed a cheese so much. Is it Swiss?\"\n\n25\n00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,800\n\"Or is it French?\" asked Mouse.\n\n26\n00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,920\n\"French,\" said Cat. \"A gift from my cousin Pierre.\"\n\n27\n00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,320\n(Actually, it was common old rat-trap cheese, as Dog and Mouse knew very well.)\n\n28\n00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:41,000\nDog said, \"It has been so pleasant, dear Cat. I hope you will have dinner with me tomorrow night.\"\n\n29\n00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,760\nCat thought for a moment.\n\"I will, indeed,\" he said, \"if I may bring a friend.\"\n\n30\n00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,760\n\"Good company makes for good eating,\" said Dog.\n\"Bring any friend you like. Shall we say seven o'clock?\"\n\n31\n00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,480\n\"Seven will be fine,\" said Cat.\n\n32\n00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,240\nAt seven the next night, Cat knocked on Dog's door.\n\n33\n00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:11,100\nBeside him stood Wolf -- twice as big as Dog. Four times as fierce.\n\n34\n00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,020\n\"Come in, come in!\" called Dog.\n\n35\n00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,040\nCat looked at Wolf. He whispered, \"Dog for you. Mouse for me? Agreed?\"\n\n36\n00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:27,580\nWolf said nothing, but curled his lip in a horrid smile. All his sharp teeth were showing.\n\n37\n00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,560\nCat and Wolf both licked their whiskers.\n\n38\n00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,640\nBut when the door opened, there beside Dog sat Crocodile.\n\n39\n00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,080\nHis big, toothy jaws opened and closed as he smiled at Cat and Wolf.\n\n40\n00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:49,600\nCat and Wolf stared at that gaping mouth.\nSo big! So red! So many, many teeth!\n\n41\n00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,800\nThey could not take their eyes away. Not even to look at the four pieces of cheese on the table.\n\n42\n00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,240\n\"Ummmm,\" said Wolf, looking over his shoulder at the door.\n\n43\n00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:09,300\n\"Actually,\" said Cat, \"we came to ask if we might make it another night. Neither of us is feeling well.\"\n\n44\n00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:18,180\n\"What a pity!\" said Dog, \"I had so hoped you might enjoy this delicate French cheese. Brie, it is called.\"\n\n45\n00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,700\n(And it really was French Brie.)\n\n46\n00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:27,540\n\"Another time,\" mumbled Cat as he and Wolf backed out the door.\n\n47\n00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,320\nCat thought for a moment, looking back at Crocodile.\n\n48\n00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:40,240\n\"Tomorrow night,\" he said, \"I'd like you to meet a distant relative who will be visiting me for dinner. Can you join me -- and bring your friend?\"\n\n49\n00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,680\n\"Delighted,\" said Dog.\n\"But not Crocky, here. He must get back to the river tonight.\n\n50\n00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,700\nPerhaps Mouse might come, if that is agreeable?\"\n\n51\n00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,620\n\"Splendid!\" said Cat, trying not to grin. \"I will expect you at eight o'clock.\"\n\n52\n00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,580\nAt eight the next evening Dog and Mouse knocked on Cat's door.\n\n53\n00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,040\nInside sat Lion,\n\n54\n00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,100\nso big he all but filled the house.\n\n55\n00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,920\nCat had to sit between his huge paws.\nCat was smiling.\n\n56\n00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,420\nIn the space remaining at one side was a table. It was covered with dishes of good things Cat had brought to please Lion.\n\n57\n00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,040\nThere were fresh-roasted peanuts;\n\n58\n00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,320\nfat, juicy raisins;\n\n59\n00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,960\nlittle cakes covered with sugar frosting;\n\n60\n00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,480\nbits of fried and crumbled bacon;\n\n61\n00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,360\nand a silver tray of mint candies.\n\n62\n00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:42,320\nCat looked up and whispered to Lion, \"When the door opens, I will grab Mouse, you grab Dog, and that will be that!\"\n\n63\n00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,780\n\"That!\" rumbled Lion, licking his whiskers with his rough, red tongue.\n\n64\n00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,880\n\"How prompt you are! Come in! Come in!\" cried Cat to Dog.\n\n65\n00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:03,200\nAs the door swung open, both Cat and Lion leaned forward, their mouths already open.\n\n66\n00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,940\nNeither of them had noticed that Dog and Mouse had brought their good friend, Wasp.\n\n67\n00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:16,520\nQuick as a wink, Wasp stung Lion's nose. Then his ear. Then his rough, red tongue. Lion was frantic!\n\n68\n00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,920\nHe tried to back away, but Cat's house was too tight around him.\n\n69\n00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,240\nWasp stung his lip.\n\n70\n00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,940\nLion broke the house apart and ran.\n\n71\n00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,820\nCat ran after him. And Dog after Cat.\n\n72\n00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,480\nCat's house was wrecked, but the table was unharmed.\n\n73\n00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,920\nAll the good things on it stood as they had been.\n\n74\n00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,960\n\"Good friend,\" said Mouse to Wasp, \"do help yourself to anything you fancy. Those little cakes, perhaps?\n\n75\n00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,080\nOr one of the mints? I rather like the smell of those peanuts, myself, for starters.\n\n76\n00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,940\nPlenty here for both of us, and a good share, too, for Dog, if Cat escapes what he deserves.\"\n\n77\n00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,160\nIf Cat did escape, you may be sure he never bothered Mouse again.\n\n78\n00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,960\nThe end.\n\n79\n00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,420\nWell I love that book, because it's very silly and very funny,\n\n80\n00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:21,320\nbut also because I think this book teaches us a good lesson about friendship. Actually, more than one lesson about friendship.\n\n81\n00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:31,700\nBut one of them is that it's important to have good friends around us because our good friends are our support system.\n\n82\n00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:41,140\nAnd our friends who love us will be there to protect us when things get rough, as they did for Mouse.\n\n83\n00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,940\nThanks for watching Storyline Online.

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,140\nHello, my name is Pamela Reed.\n\n2\n00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,909\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.\n\n3\n00:00:19,909 --> 00:00:27,719\nToday we're going to read the book \"Stellaluna,\" by Janell Cannon.\n\n4\n00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:31,789\nIn a warm and sultry forest, far, far away,\n\n5\n00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:37,320\n...there once lived a mother fruit bat and her new baby.\n\n6\n00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,180\nOh, how Mother Bat loved her soft, tiny baby.\n\n7\n00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,780\n\"I'll name you... Stellaluna,\" she crooned.\n\n8\n00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:51,000\nEach night, Mother Bat would carry Stellaluna clutched to her breast...\n\n9\n00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,090\n...as she flew out to search for food.\n\n10\n00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:02,180\nOne night, as Mother Bat followed the heavy scent of ripe fruit, an owl spied her.\n\n11\n00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,400\nOn silent wings, the powerful bird swooped down upon the bats.\n\n12\n00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,170\nDodging and shrieking, Mother Bat tried to escape,\n\n13\n00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,230\nbut the owl struck again and again, knocking Stellaluna into the air.\n\n14\n00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:22,120\nHer baby wings were as limp and useless as wet paper.\n\n15\n00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:30,900\nDown, down she went, faster and faster; into the forest below.\n\n16\n00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,280\nThe dark leafy tangle of branches caught Stellaluna as she fell.\n\n17\n00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,460\nOne twig was small enough for Stellaluna's tiny feet.\n\n18\n00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:49,560\nWrapping her wings about her, she clutched the thin branch, trembling with cold and fear:\n\n19\n00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,000\n\"Mother;\" Stellaluna squeaked. \"Where are you?\"\n\n20\n00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,800\nBy daybreak, the baby bat could hold on no longer.\n\n21\n00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,160\nDown, down again she dropped.\n\n22\n00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:11,420\nFlump! Stellaluna landed headfirst in a soft, downy nest,\n\n23\n00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,749\nstartling the three baby birds who lived there.\n\n24\n00:02:14,749 --> 00:02:19,829\nStellaluna quickly clambered from the nest, and hung out of sight below it.\n\n25\n00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,620\nShe listened to the babble of the three birds.\n\n26\n00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,760\n\"What was that?\" cried Flap.\n\n27\n00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,320\n\"I don't know, but it's hanging by it's feet,\" chirped Flitter.\n\n28\n00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,500\n\"Shhh! Here comes Mama,\" hissed Pip.\n\n29\n00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,139\nMany, many times that day Mama bird flew away,\n\n30\n00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:43,949\nalways returning with food for her babies.\n\n31\n00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:52,509\nStellaluna was terribly hungry - but not for the crawly things Mama Bird brought.\n\n32\n00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:55,880\nFinally, though, the little bat could bear it no longer.\n\n33\n00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:02,780\nShe climbed into the nest, closed her eyes, and opened her mouth.\n\n34\n00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:09,880\nPlop! In dropped a big green grasshopper.\n\n35\n00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,180\nStellaluna learned to be like the birds. She stayed awake all day and slept at night.\n\n36\n00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,940\nShe ate bugs, even though they tasted awful.\n\n37\n00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,200\nHer bat ways were quickly disappearing.\n\n38\n00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,219\nExcept for one thing: Stellaluna still liked to sleep hanging by her feet.\n\n39\n00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:34,609\nOnce, when Mama was away, the curious baby birds decided to try it, too.\n\n40\n00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:39,720\nWhen Mama Bird came home, she saw eight tiny feet gripping the edge of the nest.\n\n41\n00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,920\n\"Eeek!\" she cried. \"Get back up here this instant!\n\n42\n00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,069\nYou're going to fall and break your necks!\"\n\n43\n00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:52,290\nThe birds clambered back into the nest, but Mama Bird stopped Stellaluna.\n\n44\n00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:56,919\n\"You are teaching my children to do bad things.\"\n\n45\n00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,800\n\"I will not let you back into this nest, unless you promise to obey all the rules of this house.\"\n\n46\n00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,900\nStellaluna promised. She ate bugs without making faces.\n\n47\n00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,599\nShe slept in the nest at night. And she didn't hang by her feet.\n\n48\n00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,999\nStellaluna behaved as a good bird should.\n\n49\n00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:24,530\nAll the babies grew quickly. Soon the nest became crowded.\n\n50\n00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,059\nMama Bird told them it was time to learn to fly.\n\n51\n00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,180\nOne by one, Pip, Flitter, Flap, and Stellaluna jumped from the nest.\n\n52\n00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:41,120\nTheir wings worked! \"I'm just like them,\" thought Stellaluna. \"I can fly, too.\"\n\n53\n00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,580\nPip, Flitter, and Flap landed gracefully on a branch.\n\n54\n00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,419\nStellaluna tried to do the same.\n\n55\n00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,080\nHow embarrassing!\n\n56\n00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:05,940\nI will fly all day, Stellaluna told herself. Then no one will see how clumsy I am.\n\n57\n00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:11,860\nThe next day, Pip, Flitter, Flap, and Stellaluna went flying far from home.\n\n58\n00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,300\nThey flew for hours, exercising their new wings.\n\n59\n00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:24,720\n\"The sun is setting,\" warned Flitter.\n\"We had better go home, or we will get lost in the dark,\" said Flap.\n\n60\n00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:36,480\nBut Stellaluna had flown far ahead, and was nowhere to be seen. The three anxious birds went home without her.\n\n61\n00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:44,479\nAll alone, Stellaluna flew and flew until her wings ached and she dropped into a tree.\n\n62\n00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:50,640\n\"I promised not to hang by my feet,\" Stellaluna sighed.\n\n63\n00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,500\nSo she hung by her thumbs, and soon fell asleep.\n\n64\n00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:04,560\nShe didn't hear the soft sound of wings coming near.\n\n65\n00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,039\n\"Hey!\" a loud voice said. \"Why are you hanging upside down?\"\n\n66\n00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,260\nStellaluna's eyes opened wide. She saw a most peculiar face.\n\n67\n00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,300\n\"I'm not upside down, you are!\" Stellaluna said.\n\n68\n00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,660\n\"Ah, but you're a bat. Bats hang by their feet. \"\n\n69\n00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:31,180\n\"You are hanging by your thumbs, so that makes you upside down!\" the creature said.\n\n70\n00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:38,760\n\"I'm a bat. I am hanging by my feet. That makes me right side up!\"\n\n71\n00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:47,640\nStellaluna was confused. \"Mama Bird told me I was upside down. She said I was wrong...\"\n\n72\n00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:53,400\n\"Wrong for a bird, maybe... but not for a bat.\"\n\n73\n00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,740\nMore bats gathered around to see the strange young bat who behaved like a bird.\n\n74\n00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,199\nStellaluna told them her story.\n\n75\n00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,580\n\"You ate b-bugs?\" Stuttered one.\n\n76\n00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,969\n\"You slept at night?\" gasped another.\n\n77\n00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:17,080\n\"How very strange,\" they all murmured.\n\n78\n00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:24,400\n\"Wait, wait! Let me look at this child!\" A bat pushed through the crowd.\n\n79\n00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,219\n\"An owl attacked you?\" she asked.\n\n80\n00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:38,540\nSniffing Stellaluna's fur, she whispered, \"You are Stellaluna. You are my baby.\"\n\n81\n00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,840\n\"You escaped the owl?\" cried Stellaluna. \"You survived?\"\n\n82\n00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,400\n\"Yes,\" said Mother Bat as she wrapped her wings around Stellaluna.\n\n83\n00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:02,479\n\"Come with me, and I'll show you where to find the most delicious fruit.\"\n\n84\n00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,779\n\"You'll never have to eat another bug as long as you live.\"\n\n85\n00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:16,989\n\"But it's nighttime,\" Stellaluna squeaked. \"We can't fly in the dark or we will crash into trees.\"\n\n86\n00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:23,940\n\"We're bats,\" said Mother Bat. \"We can see in darkness. Come with us.\"\n\n87\n00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:31,499\nStellaluna was afraid, but she let go of the tree and dropped into the deep blue sky.\n\n88\n00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:37,340\nStellaluna could see. She felt as though rays of light shone from her eyes.\n\n89\n00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,180\nShe was able to see everything in her path.\n\n90\n00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:48,870\nSoon the bats found a mango tree, and Stellaluna ate as much of the fruit as she could hold.\n\n91\n00:08:48,870 --> 00:09:02,490\n\"I'll never eat another bug as long as I live,\" cheered Stellaluna as she stuffed herself full. \"I must tell Pip, Flitter, and Flap!\"\n\n92\n00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:09,300\nThe next day Stellaluna went to visit the birds. \"Come with me and meet my bat family,\" said Stellaluna.\n\n93\n00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,040\n\"Okay, let's go,\" agreed Pip.\n\n94\n00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,120\n\"They hang by their feet and they fly at night and they eat the best food in the world,\" Stellaluna explained to the birds on the way.\n\n95\n00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,740\nAs the birds flew among the bats, Flap said, \"I feel upside down here.\"\n\n96\n00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,640\nSo the birds hung by their feet.\n\n97\n00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,050\n\"Wait until dark,\" Stellaluna said excitedly. \"We will fly at night.\"\n\n98\n00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:42,600\nWhen night came, Stellaluna flew away. Pip, Flitter, and Flap leapt from the tree to follow her.\n\n99\n00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,340\n\"I can't see a thing!\" yelled Pip.\n\n100\n00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,800\n\"Neither can I,\" howled Flitter.\n\n101\n00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,740\n\"Aaeee!\" shrieked Flap.\n\n102\n00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:56,320\n\"They're going to crash,\" gasped Stellaluna. \"I must rescue them!\"\n\n103\n00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:04,280\nStellaluna swooped about, grabbing her friends in the air. She lifted them to a tree, and the birds grasped a branch.\n\n104\n00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,440\nStellaluna hung from the limb above them.\n\n105\n00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,100\n\"We're safe,\" said Stellaluna. Then she sighed.\n\n106\n00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,410\n\"I wish you could see in the dark too.\"\n\n107\n00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,290\n\"We wish you could land on your feet,\" Flitter replied. Pip and Flap nodded.\n\n108\n00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,690\nThey perched in silence for a long time.\n\n109\n00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:31,950\n\"How can we be so different and feel so much alike?\" mused Flitter.\n\n110\n00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:37,990\n\"And how can we feel so different and be so much alike?\" wondered Pip.\n\n111\n00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,810\n\"I think this is quite a mystery.\" Flap chirped.\n\n112\n00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,680\n\"I agree,\" said Stellaluna. \"But we're friends.\"\n\n113\n00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,250\n\"And that's a fact.\"\n\n114\n00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,450\nI really like this book, and I hope you do too.\n\n115\n00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:01,340\nAnd I hope you enjoy all the things that you have with your friends that are the same...\n\n116\n00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,890\n...and especially all the things that are different.\n\n117\n00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,400\nHappy reading!",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,680\nHello.\n\n2\n00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,980\nWelcome to Storyline Online, brought to you\nby the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n3\n00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,100\nI'm Rose Byrne, and today I'm going to be\nreading\n\n4\n00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,260\nThe Tale of Peter Rabbit,\nwritten and illustrated by Beatrix Potter.\n\n5\n00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,560\nOnce upon a time there were four little rabbits,\n\n6\n00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,120\nand their names were\nFlopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter.\n\n7\n00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,800\nThey lived with their Mother in a sand-bank,\nunderneath the root of a very big fir tree.\n\n8\n00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,300\n\"Now my dears,\" said the old Mrs. Rabbit one\nmorning,\n\n9\n00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,300\n\"you may go into the fields or down the lane,\n\n10\n00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,240\nbut don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden.\n\n11\n00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,780\nYour Father had an accident there.\n\n12\n00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,600\nHe was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor.\"\n\n13\n00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,300\n\"Now run along, and don't get into mischief.\n\n14\n00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,720\nI am going out.\"\n\n15\n00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,149\nThen old Mrs. Rabbit took a basket and her\numbrella,\n\n16\n00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:57,920\nand went through the wood to the baker's.\n\n17\n00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,660\nShe bought a loaf of brown bread and five\ncurrant buns.\n\n18\n00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,820\nFlopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail,\nwho were good little bunnies,\n\n19\n00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,600\nwent down the lane to gather blackberries.\n\n20\n00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,920\nBut Peter, who was very naughty,\n\n21\n00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,960\nran straight away to Mr. McGregor's garden,\n\n22\n00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,000\nand squeezed under the gate!\n\n23\n00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,900\nFirst he ate some lettuces\nand then some French beans,\n\n24\n00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,500\nand then he ate some radishes.\n\n25\n00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:31,979\nAnd then, feeling rather sick,\nhe went to look for some parsley.\n\n26\n00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,420\nBut round the end of a cucumber frame,\n\n27\n00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,160\nwhom should he meet but Mr. McGregor!\n\n28\n00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,520\nMr. McGregor was on his hands and knees \nplanting out young cabbages,\n\n29\n00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,720\nbut he jumped up and ran after Peter,\nwaving a rake and calling out\n\n30\n00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,780\n\"Stop thief!\"\n\n31\n00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,259\nPeter was most dreadfully frightened.\n\n32\n00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,540\nHe rushed all over the garden,\nfor he had forgotten the way back to the gate.\n\n33\n00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,960\nHe lost one of his shoes amongst the cabbages,\n\n34\n00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,800\nand the other shoe amongst the potatoes.\n\n35\n00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,300\nAfter losing them, he ran on four legs and\nwent faster,\n\n36\n00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,820\nso I think he might have got away altogether\n\n37\n00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,880\nif he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net,\n\n38\n00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,219\nand got caught by the large buttons on his jacket.\n\n39\n00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:19,129\nIt was a blue jacket with brass buttons;\nit was quite new.\n\n40\n00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,800\nPeter gave himself up for lost,\nand shed big tears,\n\n41\n00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,180\nbut his sobs were overheard by some friendly\nsparrows,\n\n42\n00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,380\nwho flew to him in great excitement, and implored\nhim to exert himself.\n\n43\n00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,680\nMr. McGregor came up with a sieve,\nwhich he intended to pop upon the top of Peter.\n\n44\n00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,730\nBut Peter wriggled out just in time,\nleaving his jacket behind him.\n\n45\n00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,640\nAnd rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped\ninto a can.\n\n46\n00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,060\nIt would have been a beautiful thing\nto hide in,\n\n47\n00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,120\nif it had not had so much water in it.\n\n48\n00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,960\nMr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was\nsomewhere in the tool-shed,\n\n49\n00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,300\nperhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot.\n\n50\n00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,400\nHe began to turn them over carefully, looking\nunder each.\n\n51\n00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,820\nPresently, Peter sneezed.\n\n52\n00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,300\n\"Kertyschoo!\"\n\n53\n00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,140\nMr. McGregor was after him in no time\n\n54\n00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,400\nand tried to put his foot upon Peter,\nwho jumped out of a window,\n\n55\n00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,060\nupsetting three plants.\n\n56\n00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,609\nThe window was too small for Mr. McGregor,\nand he was tired of running after Peter.\n\n57\n00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,260\nHe went back to his work.\n\n58\n00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,020\nPeter sat down to rest.\n\n59\n00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,480\nHe was out of breath and trembling with fright,\n\n60\n00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,100\nand he had not the least idea which way to go.\n\n61\n00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,140\nAlso he was very damp with sitting in that\ncan.\n\n62\n00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,433\nAfter a time he began to wander about,\n\n63\n00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:43,409\ngoing lippity—lippity—not very fast,\nand looking all around.\n\n64\n00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:46,900\nHe found a door in a wall, but it was locked,\n\n65\n00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,360\nand there was no room for a fat\nlittle rabbit to squeeze underneath.\n\n66\n00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,449\nAn old mouse was running in and out over the\nstone doorstep,\n\n67\n00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:57,889\ncarrying peas and beans to her family in the\nwood.\n\n68\n00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,019\nPeter asked her the way to the gate,\nbut she had such a large pea in her mouth\n\n69\n00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:04,170\nthat she could not answer.\n\n70\n00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,819\nShe only shook her head at him.\n\n71\n00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,240\nPeter began to cry.\n\n72\n00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,040\nThen he tried to find his way straight across\nthe garden,\n\n73\n00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,510\nbut he became more and more puzzled.\n\n74\n00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:20,659\nPresently, he came to a pond where Mr. McGregor\nfilled his water-cans.\n\n75\n00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:24,330\nA white cat was staring at some gold-fish.\n\n76\n00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,189\nShe sat very, very still,\nbut now and then the tip of her tail twitched\n\n77\n00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:32,669\nas if it were alive.\n\n78\n00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:35,990\nPeter thought it best to go away without speaking\nto her.\n\n79\n00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,569\nHe had heard about cats from his cousin,\n little Benjamin Bunny.\n\n80\n00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:43,259\nHe went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly,\n\n81\n00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,660\nquite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe.\n\n82\n00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,420\nScr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch.\n\n83\n00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,880\nPeter scuttered underneath the bushes.\n\n84\n00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,320\nBut presently, as nothing happened,\nhe came out,\n\n85\n00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,040\nand climbed upon a wheelbarrow\nand peeped over.\n\n86\n00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,300\nThe first thing he saw was Mr. McGregor hoeing\nonions.\n\n87\n00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,710\nHis back was turned towards Peter,\nand beyond him was the gate!\n\n88\n00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,600\nPeter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow\n\n89\n00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,940\nand started running as fast as he could go,\n\n90\n00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,620\nalong a straight walk behind some black-currant\nbushes.\n\n91\n00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,000\nMr. McGregor caught sight of him in the corner,\nbut Peter did not care.\n\n92\n00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,620\nHe slipped underneath the gate, and was safe\nat last in the wood outside the garden.\n\n93\n00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,260\nMr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and\nthe shoes for a scare-crow\n\n94\n00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,939\nto frighten the blackbirds.\n\n95\n00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,640\nPeter never stopped running or looked behind\nhim till he got home to the big fir-tree.\n\n96\n00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:46,580\nHe was so tired that he flopped down upon\nthe nice soft sand\n\n97\n00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,660\non the floor of the rabbit-hole\nand shut his eyes.\n\n98\n00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,720\nHis mother was busy cooking.\n\n99\n00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,759\nShe wondered what he had done with his clothes.\n\n100\n00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,629\nIt was the second little jacket and pair of\nshoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight!\n\n101\n00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,150\nI am sorry to say that Peter was not very\nwell during the evening.\n\n102\n00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,210\nHis mother put him to bed,\nand made some camomile tea.\n\n103\n00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,360\nAnd she gave a dose of it to Peter!\n\n104\n00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,080\n\"One table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.\"\n\n105\n00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,760\nBut Flopsy, Mopsy, and Cotton-tail\n\n106\n00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:21,420\nhad bread and milk and\nblackberries for supper.\n\n107\n00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,040\nThe End\n\n108\n00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,300\nThank you so much for joining me in reading\nPeter Rabbit.\n\n109\n00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,060\nIt's one
