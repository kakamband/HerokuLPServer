No one ate lunch with Clark.\n\n22\n00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,300\nNo one sat with him at circle time. Even his best friend, Joey Mackerel, said,\n\n23\n00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,760\n“Cool your jets, Clark! You’re making me crazy!”\n\n24\n00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,960\nOne day, Clark asked Mrs. Inkydink, “What’s wrong with everyone?”\n\n25\n00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,360\nMrs. Inkydink patted his fin.\n\n26\n00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:13,080\n“Clark, sometimes you play too hard, you munch too hard, and —gosh— you even help too hard.”\n\n27\n00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,360\n“But life is SO exciting!” said Clark.\n\n28\n00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,240\n“There’s a time and a place for everything,” said Mrs. Inkydink.\n\n29\n00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,580\n“And sometimes the rule is stay cool.”\n\n30\n00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:32,360\nAt recess, Clark tried to stay cool, but he pushed the swing with too much zing!\n\n31\n00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,380\n“Sorry,” said Clark. “I forgot.”\n\n32\n00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,540\n“Yikes!” cried Joey Mackerel.\n\n33\n00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:47,880\nAt lunch, Clark tried to stay cool, but everything smelled so good that he munched a bunch of lunches.\n\n34\n00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:54,700\n“Sorry,” said Clark. “I forgot.”\n“We’re STARVING!” said his friends.\n\n35\n00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,000\nIn class, Clark tried to stay cool, but a good book got him all shook up.\n\n36\n00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,880\n“Now, Clark!” said Mrs. Inkydink. “This isn’t the time or the place. Tell me, what’s the rule?”\n\n37\n00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,020\n“Stay cool,” said Clark.\n“Hey, that rhymes!” he cried.\n\n38\n00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,060\nThen Clark got a big idea in his sharky head.\n\n39\n00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,800\nMaybe if I make a rhyme, I’ll remember every time! he thought.\n\n40\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,800\nThe next day, he put his plan to work.\n\n41\n00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,800\nIn class, when lessons got exciting, Clark wanted to bounce up out of his seat.\n\n42\n00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,800\nInstead, he told himself: “When teacher’s talking, don’t go walking.”\n\n43\n00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,620\nAnd what do you know? It worked!\n\n44\n00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,300\n“Attaboy, Clark!” said Mrs. Inkydink. Clark smiled. “Lessons are fun!”\n\n45\n00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,020\nAt lunch, everything smelled sooo yummy.\n\n46\n00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,300\nWhen Clark wanted to eat and eat and never stop, he told himself: “Only munch your own lunch.”\n\n47\n00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,040\nAnd it worked again!\n“Way to go, Clark!” said his friends.\n\n48\n00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,760\nClark grinned. “Lunch is fun.”\n\n49\n00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,340\nAt playtime, Clark told himself: “Easy does it, that’s the way.\n\n50\n00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,100\n“Then my friends will let me play.”\n\n51\n00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,200\nAnd playtime was fun. Once more, Clark loved his life.\n\n52\n00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,100\nBut then a shadow fell across the playground—\n\n53\n00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,640\na gi-normous shadow with tentacles galore.\n\n54\n00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,640\n“It’s a new kid, and he looks scary!” cried Joey Mackerel. “Swim for your lives!”\n\n55\n00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:37,500\nThe squid squashed the slide, and it snapped off the swings.\n\n56\n00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,860\n“Oops. My bad,” said the new kid.\n\n57\n00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,760\n“Wait,” said Clark. “He just wants to play. Let’s find a way!”\n\n58\n00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,440\nAnd he swam at the new kid with all his might.\n\n59\n00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,900\nClark played harder than he ever had before— \nupsy-downsy and spinna-ma-jig.\n\n60\n00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,880\nWhy, he even made up a new game: tail-whump-a-lumpus!\n\n61\n00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,120\n“Wow, that was fun,” said the new kid breathlessly, and he settled down.\n\n62\n00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,500\n“If you want to come to school, you’ve got to stay cool,” said Clark.\n\n63\n00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,280\n“That’s right, Clark,” said Mrs. Inkydink.\n\n64\n00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,880\n“And thanks for taking care of our new classmate, Sid the Squid.”\n\n65\n00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,000\n“Hooray for Clark the Shark!” everyone cheered.\n\n66\n00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,600\nThat night Clark’s mother asked, “What did you learn at school, dear?”\n\n67\n00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:33,340\n“There’s a time and a place for everything,” Clark said.\n\n68\n00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:37,000\n“Sometimes you stay cool.”\n\n69\n00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,680\n“But sometimes a shark’s gotta do what a shark’s gotta do.”\n\n70\n00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,260\nThe end.\n\n71\n00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,340\nThat was Clark the Shark everybody.\n\n72\n00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,060\nI think it speaks to all of us.\n\n73\n00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,080\nIt talks about how we all want to do what we want to do , right?\n\n74\n00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,060\nWe want to be ourselves.\n\n75\n00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360\nand we want to yell when we want to yell and play and laugh and have a good time.\n\n76\n00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,580\nBut as Mrs. Inkydink said, there's a time and a place for everything.\n\n77\n00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,660\nAnd there is a time and a place to be considerate of other people's feelings.\n\n78\n00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,900\nI think the lesson is: Be considerate.\n\n79\n00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,860\nThank you so much for watching Storyline Online.\n\n80\n00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,780\nMake sure to check out all of the other stories.\n\n81\n00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,780\nKeep watching and keep reading.\n\n82\n00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,260\nyou",
