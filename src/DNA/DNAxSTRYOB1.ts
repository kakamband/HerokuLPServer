He should be home for supper.\"\n12\n00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,340\nJust then the door burst open, and his friend\nHarley rushed in.\n13\n00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,860\n\"Grab your boots, Georgie,

00:01:04,320\nCome on, we don't want to miss it.\"\n20\n00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,700\nHarely had a wheelbarrow out\nfront.\n21\n00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,979\nThey started walking down the road.\n22\n00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,370\nGeorgie had a lot of questions.\n23\n00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,670\n\"What's the wheelbarrow for?\" he asked.\n24\n00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,990\n\"It's a surprise.\n25\n00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,840\nThe train's carrying something special.\"\n26\n00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,450\nGeorgie's heart beat faster.\n27\n00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,200\n\"Where's

Harley.\n34\n00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,789\nThey walked to the train depot at the edge\nof town.\n35\n00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:37,359\n\"Is this where the black gold is?\"\n36\n00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,359\nGeorgie asked.\n37\n00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,299\n\"Quiet, we don't want anyone to see us.\"\n38\n00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,659\n\"Why not?\" he whispered.\n39\n00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,770\n\"It'll spoil the surprise.\"\n40\n00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,469\nHarley crouch down behind a locomotive, so\nGeorgie did the same.\n41\n00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:48,939\nIt was cold.\n42\n00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,560\nGeorgie's toes stuck out of the holes in his\nboots.\n43\n00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,369\nThe blast of the a whistle made him jump.\n44\n00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,090\n\"Here she comes!\"\n45\n00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,240\nHarley cried.\n46\n00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,590\nA steam engine pulled into the station.\n47\n00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,619\nHarley jumped up.\n48\n00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,939\n\"This way, Georgie.\"\n49\n00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,740\nThey ran along the tracks to the end of the\ntrain.\n50\n00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,179\nHarley lifted him up the side of a rail car.\n51\n00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,179\nGeorgie looked inside.\n52\n00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:14,019\nIt was filled with chunks of coal.\n53\n00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,580\nAn entire mountain of it.\n54\n00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,880\nBlack gold.\n55\n00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,540\nGeogrie looked down at Harley.\n56\n00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,739\n\"What should I do?\"\n57\n00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,610\n\"Climb inside and toss some over.\"\n58\n00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,610\nGeogie blinked.\n59\n00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,959\n\"Isn't that stealing?\"\n60\n00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,980\nHarley scowled at him.\n61\n00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,070\n\"Ain't you tired of being cold every morning?\"\n62\n00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,590\n\"Yes, but--\" \"Don't be a chicken, Georgie,\nor I'll tell on you and say it was your idea.\"\n63\n00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,799\nGeorgie slowly climbed over the top and landed\non hard lumps.\n64\n00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,060\nHe pick one up and tossed it over.\n65\n00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,909\nHarley caught it and it on the ground.\n66\n00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,670\n\"Another,\" he said.\n67\n00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,030\nGeorgie grabbed two lumps and dropped them\ndown.\n68\n00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,189\nHarley grinned up at him.\n69\n00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,329\n\"It's gonna be a long winter, Georgie.\n70\n00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,849\nKeep it coming.\"\n71\n00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,610\nGeorgie began throwing the pieces faster and\nfaster.\n72\n00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,790\nSuddenly the train gave a jerk.\n73\n00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,790\nGeorgie fell backward.\n74\n00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,319\n\"Georgie, get of there!\"\n75\n00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,319\nHarely called.\n76\n00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,300\nbut the mountain of coal had swallowed him\nup.\n77\n00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720\nThe train began to pick up speed.\n78\n00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,600\n\"Help me, Harley!\" Geogie shouted.\n79\n00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,670\nHe tried to push off the coal, but he just\nsank deeper into the pile.\n80\n00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,340\nThen papa's head appeard over the top of the\nrailcar.\n81\n00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,390\n\"Time to go, Georgie\" Papa reached out his\nhand and pulled Georgie free.\n82\n00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,280\nThey sat on the edge of the railcar.\n83\n00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,480\nWhen Papa said jump, Georgie jumped.\n84\n00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,170\nPapa helped Georgie to his feet.\n85\n00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,460\n\"If I hadn't seen you boys head this way,\nyou'd be half way to Texas by now.\"\n86\n00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:39,780\nGeorgie craned his neck, looking for Harley,\nbut his friend had turned tail and run.\n87\n00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,370\n\"Sorry, Papa.\"\n88\n00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,689\n\"You know stealing's wrong?\"\n89\n00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,269\nPapa said sternly.\n90\n00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,959\nGeorgie nodded, feeling the shame curl his\ntoes.\n91\n00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,899\nThey walked back to the little mountain of\ncoal.\n92\n00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,000\nPapa scratched his head.\n93\n00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,659\n\"Train's gone now.\n94\n00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,680\nWe can't give back the coal.\n95\n00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,799\nBut I've got an idea what to do with it.\n96\n00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,209\nHelp me load it.\"\n97\n00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,370\nThey rolled the wheelbarrow down the street\nto a house with a sagging front porch.\n98\n00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,799\n\"This is widow Kolbach's house,\" Georgie said.\n99\n00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,870\nPapa handed him two large chunks of coal.\n100\n00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,819\n\"Leave this by her door.\n101\n00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,799\nThen knock twice and run on back here.\"\n102\n00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,959\nGeorgie climbed the steps.\n103\n00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,630\nThe porch creaked under his weight.\n104\n00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,840\nDropping the coal, Georgie rapped his knuckles\non the door and ran back to Papa.\n105\n00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,560\nThey hid behind some bushes.\n106\n00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,080\nAfter a moment, Mrs. Kolbach opened the door.\n107\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479\nWhen she spied the coal, she lifted it up.\n108\n00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,419\nholding it to her chest and cried, \"God bless\nyou!\"\n109\n00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,810\nGeogie's heart felt so warm it sent tingles\nright down to his toes.\n110\n00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,060\n\"Who else, Papa?\"\n111\n00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,090\n\"Come on, the Children's Home is just down\nthe road.\"\n112\n00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,460\nThey trundled the cart to a large brick house.\n113\n00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,780\nKids ran about in the yard.\n114\n00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,740\nOne of the boys came over to the fence.\n115\n00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,900\nGeorgie piled chunks of coal in his arms.\n116\n00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,310\n\"Thank you,\" the boy said.\n117\n00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,199\n\"we've been freezing all winter.\"\n118\n00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,789\nHe shivered in the thin shirt that he wore.\n119\n00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,720\nGeorgie hesitated, then took off his coat.\n120\n00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,360\n\"Here, take this.\n121\n00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,000\nIt's too small for me anyway.\"\n122\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,849\nThe boy's eyes grew wide.\n123\n00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,569\n\"You mean it?\"\n124\n00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,029\nGeorgie nodded, piling the coat on top of\nthe boy's arms.\n125\n00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,880\nPapa had many more stops to make.\n126\n00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:26,240\nBy the time they got home, Georgie was covered\ncoal dust from elbow to ears, and there was\n127\n00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,250\nonly one chunk of coal left.\n128\n00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,639\n\"Who are we giving this last piece to?\"\n129\n00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,789\n\"That's for your mother,\" Papa winked.\n130\n00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:36,930\n\"Maybe she won't notice you gave away your\ngood coat.\"\n131\n00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,960\nThey reached the porch.\n132\n00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,100\nGeorgie climbed the steps, but Papa turned\nto go.\n133\n00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,750\n\"Aren't you coming in, Papa?\"\n134\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,759\n\"I still have a days work to do, son.\n135\n00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,830\nRun along now.\"\n136\n00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,830\nGeorgie hesitated.\n137\n00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,870\nThen he ran down the steps and threw his arms\naround Papa's waist.\n138\n00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,300\n\"I love you Papa.\"\n139\n00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,569\nPapa patted Georgie on the head.\n140\n00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,770\n\"I love you too, little coal thief.\"\n141\n00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,310\nThe end.\n142\n00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,620\nWow.\n143\n00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,389\nWhat a great story.\n144\n00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,550\nIt really got me at the end there.\n145\n00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,960\nI think that's definitely one of the things\nthat I love about reading.\n146\n00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,120\nThat you can really just get absorbed and\nlost and really put yourself in another person's shoes.\n147\n00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,509\nYou know, when ever a book does something\nlike that for me I think it's an extraordinary\n148\n00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,620\nand wonderful experience.\n149\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,870\nI'm grateful I got the opportunity to read\nand read it to you.\n",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,760\nHello, and welcome to the Screen Actors Guild Foundation BookPALS.\n\n2\n00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,980\nMy name is Sean Astin and I played Sam in \"Lord of the Rings.\"\n\n3\n00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:25,150\nI love to read, especially to kids. I have a daughter whose name is Allie and she loves it when I read to her, and we both love lima beans. Hmm.\n\n4\n00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:38,580\nThe story I'm going to read to you is called \"A Bad Case of Stripes,\" written and illustrated by David Shannon. Allie loves this book. I hope you do too.\n\n5\n00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:55,480\nCamilla Cream loved lima beans, but she never ate them. All of her friends hated lima beans and she wanted to fit in.\n\n6\n00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:04,240\nCamilla was always worried about what other people thought of her. Today she was fretting even more than usual.\n\n7\n00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,820\nIt was the first day of school and she couldn't decide what to wear. There were so many people to impress.\n\n8\n00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:22,190\nShe tried on forty-two outfits but none seemed quite right. She put on a pretty red dress and looked into the mirror.\n\n9\n00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:33,000\nAnd then she screamed. Her mother ran into the room, and she screamed too. \"Oh my heavens,\" she cried, \"You're completely covered with stripes!\"\n\n10\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,080\nThis was certainly true. Camilla was striped from head to toe. S he looked like a rainbow.\n\n11\n00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:48,760\nMrs. Cream felt Camilla's forehead.\n\"Do you feel alright?\" she asked.\n\"I feel fine,\" Camilla answered. \"But just look at me.\"\n\n12\n00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,260\n\"You get back in bed this instant!\" Her mother ordered. \"You're not going to school today!\"\n\n13\n00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,920\nCamilla was relieved. She didn't want to miss the first day of school, but she was afraid of what the other kids might say.\n\n14\n00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,880\nShe had no idea what to wear with those crazy stripes.\n\n15\n00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,440\nThat afternoon, Dr. Bumble came to examine Camilla. \"Most extraordinary!\" he exclaimed. \"I've never seen anything like it!\"\n\n16\n00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:28,340\n\"Are you having any coughing, sneezing, runny nose, aches, pains, chills, hot flashes, dizziness, drowsiness, shortness of breath, or uncontrollable twitching?\"\n\n17\n00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:39,720\n\"No,\" Camilla told him. \"I feel fine\".\n\"Well then,\" Dr. Bumble said, turning to Mrs. Cream. \"I don't see any reason why she shouldn't go to school tomorrow.\n\n18\n00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:50,969\nHere is some ointment that should help her clear up those stripes in a few days. If it doesn't, you know where to reach me.\" \nAnd off he went.\n\n19\n00:02:50,969 --> 00:03:02,609\nThe next day was a disaster. Everyone at school laughed at Camilla. They called her Camilla Crayon and Night of the Living Lollipop.\n\n20\n00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:15,280\nShe tried her best to act as if everything were normal. But when the class said the Pledge of Allegiance, her stripes turned red, white and blue, and she broke out in stars.\n\n21\n00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,400\nThe other kids thought this was great. One yelled out, \"Let's see some purple polka dots!\"\n\n22\n00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:30,160\nSure enough, Camilla turned all purple polka dots. Someone else shouted, \"Checkerboard!\" and a pattern of squares covered her skin.\n\n23\n00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:41,100\nSoon everyone was calling out different shapes and colors, and poor Camilla was changing faster than you can change channels on a TV.\n\n24\n00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:50,020\nThat night, Mr. Harms, the school principal, called.\n\"I'm sorry, Mrs. Cream,\" he said. \"I am going to have to ask you to keep Camilla home from school.\"\n\n25\n00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:58,760\nShe's just too much of a distraction, and I've been getting calls from the other parents. They're afraid those stripes may be contagious.\"\n\n26\n00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:08,880\nCamilla was so embarrassed. She couldn't believe that two days ago everyone liked her. Now, nobody wanted to be in the same room with her.\n\n27\n00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:17,000\nHer father tried to make her feel better.\n\"Is there anything I can get you, sweetheart?\" he asked.\n\n28\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:28,440\n\"No, thank you,\" sighed Camilla.\nWhat she really wanted was nice plate of lima beans, but she had been laughed at enough for one day.\n\n29\n00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:45,360\n\"Hmmm, well yes, I see,\" Dr. Bumble mumbled when Mr. Cream phoned the next day. \"I think I better bring in the specialists. We'll be right over.\"\n\n30\n00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,070\nAbout an hour later Dr. Bumble arrived with 4 people in long white coats.\n\n31\n00:04:50,070 --> 00:05:01,360\nHe introduced them to the Creams. \"This is Dr. Grop, Dr. Sponge, Dr. Cricket, and Dr. Young\".\nThen the specialists went to work on Camilla.\n\n32\n00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:11,860\nThey squeezed, jabbed, tapped, and tested. It was very uncomfortable.\n\"Well, it's not the mumps,\" concluded Dr. Grop.\n\n33\n00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:21,050\n\"Or the measles,\" said Dr. Sponge.\n\"Definitely not chicken pox,\" put in Dr. Cricket.\n\"Or sunburn,\" said Dr. Young.\n\n34\n00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,320\n\"Try these,\" said the specialists. They each handed her a bottle filled with different colored pills.\n\n35\n00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,620\n\"Take one of each before bed,\" said Dr. Grop.\nThen they filed out the front door, followed by Dr. Bumble.\n\n36\n00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:50,080\nThat night Camilla took her medicine. It was awful. When she woke up the next morning, she did feel different, but when she got dressed her clothes didn't fit right.\n\n37\n00:05:50,080 --> 00:06:03,040\nShe looked in the mirror and there staring back at her was a giant, multi-colored pill with her face on it.\n\n38\n00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:11,700\nDr. Bumble rushed over as soon as Mrs. Cream called, but this time instead of the specialists, he brought the experts.\n\n39\n00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:20,400\nDr. Gourd and Mr. Melon were the finest scientific minds in the land. Once again Camilla was poked and prodded, looked at and listened to.\n\n40\n00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,820\nThe experts wrote down lots of numbers and then they huddled together and whispered.\n\n41\n00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:36,020\nDr. Gourd finally spoke. \"It might be a virus,\" he announced with authority. Suddenly, funny little virus balls appeared all over Camilla.\n\n42\n00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,940\n\"Or possibly some form of bacteria,\" said Mr. Melon.\n\n43\n00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:52,040\nOut popped squiggly little bacteria tails.\n\"Or it could be a fungus,\" added Dr. Gourd. Instantly Camilla was covered with different colored fungus blotches.\n\n44\n00:06:52,040 --> 00:07:02,340\nThe experts looked at Camilla and then at each other. \"We need to go over the numbers again back at the lab,\" Dr. Gourd explained.\n\n45\n00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,180\n\"We'll call you when we know something.\" \nBut the experts didn't have a clue, much less a cure.\n\n46\n00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,240\nBy now the TV news had found out about Camilla.\n\n47\n00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,340\nReporters from every channel were outside her house telling the story of the bizarre case of the incredible changing kid.\n\n48\n00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,439\nSoon a huge crowd was camped out on the front lawn.\n\n49\n00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:33,020\nThe Creams were swamped with all kinds of remedies from psychologists, allergists, herbalists, nutritionists, psychics, an old medicine man,\n\n50\n00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,480\na guru and even a veterinarian.\n\n51\n00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,600\nEach so-called cure only added to poor Camilla's strange appearance, until it was hard to even recognize her.\n\n52\n00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:53,700\nShe sprouted roots and berries, crystals, feathers, and a long furry tail, but nothing worked.\n\n53\n00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:01,280\nOne day a woman who called herself an environmental therapist claimed she could cure Camilla.\n\n54\n00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:12,840\n\"Close your eyes,\" she said. \"Breathe deeply and become one with your room.\"\n\n55\n00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:23,360\n\"Oh, I wish you wouldn't have said that!\" Camilla groaned. Slowly she began to melt into the walls of her room.\n\n56\n00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:32,880\nHer bed became her mouth, her nose was a dresser, and two paintings were her eyes. The therapist screamed and ran from the house.\n\n57\n00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:42,860\n\"What are we going to do?\" cried Mrs. Cream.\n\"It just keeps getting worse and worse,\" she began to sob.\n\n58\n00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,920\nAt that moment Mr. Cream heard a quiet little knock at the front door.\n\n59\n00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,970\nHe opened it and there stood an old woman who was just as plump and sweet as a strawberry.\n\n60\n00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,260\n\"Uh, excuse me,\" she said brightly, \"but I think I can help.\"\n\n61\n00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,660\nShe went into Camilla's room and looked around.\n\"My goodness,\" she said with a shake of her head.\n\n62\n00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,000\n\"What we have here is a bad case of stripes, one of the worst I have ever seen.\"\n\n63\n00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,720\nShe pulled a container of small green beans from her bag. \"Here,\" she said, \"These might do the trick.\"\n\"Are those magic beans?\" asked Mrs. Cream.\n\n64\n00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:37,500\n\"Oh my, no,\" replied the kind old woman. \"There's no such thing. These are just plain old lima beans. I bet you'd like some, wouldn't you?\" she asked Camilla.\n\n65\n00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:52,120\nCamilla wanted a big heaping plate full of lima beans more than just about anything, but she was still afraid to admit it. \"Yuck,\" she said, \"no one likes lima beans, especially me.\"\n\n66\n00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:03,380\n\"Oh dear,\" the old woman said sadly. \"I guess I was wrong about you.\" She put the beans back in her bag and started toward the door.\n\n67\n00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,960\nCamilla watched the old woman walk away. Those beans would taste so good.\n\n68\n00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,480\nBeing laughed at for eating them was nothing compared to what she'd been going through.\n\n69\n00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:23,880\nShe finally couldn't stand it. \"Wait!\" she cried. \"The truth is that I really love lima beans.\"\n\n70\n00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:36,800\n\"I thought so,\" the old woman said with a smile. She took a handful of beans and popped them into Camilla's mouth.\n\n71\n00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,080\n\"Mmmm\" said Camilla. Suddenly the branches, feathers, and squiggly tails began to disappear,\n\n72\n00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:53,660\nthen the whole room swirled around. When it stopped, there stood Camilla, and everything was back to normal.\n\n73\n00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,590\n\"I'm cured!\" she shouted.\n\n74\n00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:08,960\n\"Yes,\" said the old woman. \"I knew the real you was in there somewhere.\"\nShe patted Camilla on the head, then she went outside and vanished into the crowd.\n\n75\n00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,380\nAfterward Camilla wasn't quite the same. Some of the kids at school said she was weird, but she didn't care a bit.\n\n76\n00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:24,530\nShe ate all the lima beans she wanted, and she never had even a touch of stripes again.\n\n77\n00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:34,620\nWell, pretty good right? I liked it, my daughter likes it, and we like lima beans.\n\n78\n00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:45,240\nSo I don't know about you, but if you can get a hold of some of these things... well, books, lima beans, whatever, I recommend it.",
