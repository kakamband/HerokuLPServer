He should be home for supper.\"\n12\n00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,340\nJust then the door burst open, and his friend\nHarley rushed in.\n13\n00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,860\n\"Grab your boots, Georgie,

00:01:04,320\nCome on, we don't want to miss it.\"\n20\n00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,700\nHarely had a wheelbarrow out\nfront.\n21\n00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,979\nThey started walking down the road.\n22\n00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:13,370\nGeorgie had a lot of questions.\n23\n00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,670\n\"What's the wheelbarrow for?\" he asked.\n24\n00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,990\n\"It's a surprise.\n25\n00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,840\nThe train's carrying something special.\"\n26\n00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,450\nGeorgie's heart beat faster.\n27\n00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,200\n\"Where's

Harley.\n34\n00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:34,789\nThey walked to the train depot at the edge\nof town.\n35\n00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:37,359\n\"Is this where the black gold is?\"\n36\n00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:38,359\nGeorgie asked.\n37\n00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:40,299\n\"Quiet, we don't want anyone to see us.\"\n38\n00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,659\n\"Why not?\" he whispered.\n39\n00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,770\n\"It'll spoil the surprise.\"\n40\n00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,469\nHarley crouch down behind a locomotive, so\nGeorgie did the same.\n41\n00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:48,939\nIt was cold.\n42\n00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,560\nGeorgie's toes stuck out of the holes in his\nboots.\n43\n00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,369\nThe blast of the a whistle made him jump.\n44\n00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:58,090\n\"Here she comes!\"\n45\n00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,240\nHarley cried.\n46\n00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,590\nA steam engine pulled into the station.\n47\n00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,619\nHarley jumped up.\n48\n00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:04,939\n\"This way, Georgie.\"\n49\n00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:07,740\nThey ran along the tracks to the end of the\ntrain.\n50\n00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,179\nHarley lifted him up the side of a rail car.\n51\n00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:11,179\nGeorgie looked inside.\n52\n00:02:11,179 --> 00:02:14,019\nIt was filled with chunks of coal.\n53\n00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:16,580\nAn entire mountain of it.\n54\n00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,880\nBlack gold.\n55\n00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,540\nGeogrie looked down at Harley.\n56\n00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,739\n\"What should I do?\"\n57\n00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,610\n\"Climb inside and toss some over.\"\n58\n00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,610\nGeogie blinked.\n59\n00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,959\n\"Isn't that stealing?\"\n60\n00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,980\nHarley scowled at him.\n61\n00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,070\n\"Ain't you tired of being cold every morning?\"\n62\n00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,590\n\"Yes, but--\" \"Don't be a chicken, Georgie,\nor I'll tell on you and say it was your idea.\"\n63\n00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,799\nGeorgie slowly climbed over the top and landed\non hard lumps.\n64\n00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,060\nHe pick one up and tossed it over.\n65\n00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,909\nHarley caught it and it on the ground.\n66\n00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:46,670\n\"Another,\" he said.\n67\n00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,030\nGeorgie grabbed two lumps and dropped them\ndown.\n68\n00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,189\nHarley grinned up at him.\n69\n00:02:50,189 --> 00:02:52,329\n\"It's gonna be a long winter, Georgie.\n70\n00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,849\nKeep it coming.\"\n71\n00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:56,610\nGeorgie began throwing the pieces faster and\nfaster.\n72\n00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,790\nSuddenly the train gave a jerk.\n73\n00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,790\nGeorgie fell backward.\n74\n00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,319\n\"Georgie, get of there!\"\n75\n00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,319\nHarely called.\n76\n00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,300\nbut the mountain of coal had swallowed him\nup.\n77\n00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720\nThe train began to pick up speed.\n78\n00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,600\n\"Help me, Harley!\" Geogie shouted.\n79\n00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,670\nHe tried to push off the coal, but he just\nsank deeper into the pile.\n80\n00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,340\nThen papa's head appeard over the top of the\nrailcar.\n81\n00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,390\n\"Time to go, Georgie\" Papa reached out his\nhand and pulled Georgie free.\n82\n00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,280\nThey sat on the edge of the railcar.\n83\n00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,480\nWhen Papa said jump, Georgie jumped.\n84\n00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,170\nPapa helped Georgie to his feet.\n85\n00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,460\n\"If I hadn't seen you boys head this way,\nyou'd be half way to Texas by now.\"\n86\n00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:39,780\nGeorgie craned his neck, looking for Harley,\nbut his friend had turned tail and run.\n87\n00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,370\n\"Sorry, Papa.\"\n88\n00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,689\n\"You know stealing's wrong?\"\n89\n00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,269\nPapa said sternly.\n90\n00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:47,959\nGeorgie nodded, feeling the shame curl his\ntoes.\n91\n00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:50,899\nThey walked back to the little mountain of\ncoal.\n92\n00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,000\nPapa scratched his head.\n93\n00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,659\n\"Train's gone now.\n94\n00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:57,680\nWe can't give back the coal.\n95\n00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,799\nBut I've got an idea what to do with it.\n96\n00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:01,209\nHelp me load it.\"\n97\n00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:05,370\nThey rolled the wheelbarrow down the street\nto a house with a sagging front porch.\n98\n00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,799\n\"This is widow Kolbach's house,\" Georgie said.\n99\n00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,870\nPapa handed him two large chunks of coal.\n100\n00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,819\n\"Leave this by her door.\n101\n00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,799\nThen knock twice and run on back here.\"\n102\n00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:16,959\nGeorgie climbed the steps.\n103\n00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,630\nThe porch creaked under his weight.\n104\n00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,840\nDropping the coal, Georgie rapped his knuckles\non the door and ran back to Papa.\n105\n00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,560\nThey hid behind some bushes.\n106\n00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,080\nAfter a moment, Mrs. Kolbach opened the door.\n107\n00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,479\nWhen she spied the coal, she lifted it up.\n108\n00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,419\nholding it to her chest and cried, \"God bless\nyou!\"\n109\n00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:41,810\nGeogie's heart felt so warm it sent tingles\nright down to his toes.\n110\n00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,060\n\"Who else, Papa?\"\n111\n00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,090\n\"Come on, the Children's Home is just down\nthe road.\"\n112\n00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,460\nThey trundled the cart to a large brick house.\n113\n00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,780\nKids ran about in the yard.\n114\n00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,740\nOne of the boys came over to the fence.\n115\n00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,900\nGeorgie piled chunks of coal in his arms.\n116\n00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,310\n\"Thank you,\" the boy said.\n117\n00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,199\n\"we've been freezing all winter.\"\n118\n00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,789\nHe shivered in the thin shirt that he wore.\n119\n00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,720\nGeorgie hesitated, then took off his coat.\n120\n00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,360\n\"Here, take this.\n121\n00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,000\nIt's too small for me anyway.\"\n122\n00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,849\nThe boy's eyes grew wide.\n123\n00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,569\n\"You mean it?\"\n124\n00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:18,029\nGeorgie nodded, piling the coat on top of\nthe boy's arms.\n125\n00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,880\nPapa had many more stops to make.\n126\n00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:26,240\nBy the time they got home, Georgie was covered\ncoal dust from elbow to ears, and there was\n127\n00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,250\nonly one chunk of coal left.\n128\n00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,639\n\"Who are we giving this last piece to?\"\n129\n00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,789\n\"That's for your mother,\" Papa winked.\n130\n00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:36,930\n\"Maybe she won't notice you gave away your\ngood coat.\"\n131\n00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,960\nThey reached the porch.\n132\n00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,100\nGeorgie climbed the steps, but Papa turned\nto go.\n133\n00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,750\n\"Aren't you coming in, Papa?\"\n134\n00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,759\n\"I still have a days work to do, son.\n135\n00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,830\nRun along now.\"\n136\n00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,830\nGeorgie hesitated.\n137\n00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,870\nThen he ran down the steps and threw his arms\naround Papa's waist.\n138\n00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,300\n\"I love you Papa.\"\n139\n00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,569\nPapa patted Georgie on the head.\n140\n00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,770\n\"I love you too, little coal thief.\"\n141\n00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,310\nThe end.\n142\n00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,620\nWow.\n143\n00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,389\nWhat a great story.\n144\n00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,550\nIt really got me at the end there.\n145\n00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,960\nI think that's definitely one of the things\nthat I love about reading.\n146\n00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:24,120\nThat you can really just get absorbed and\nlost and really put yourself in another person's shoes.\n147\n00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,509\nYou know, when ever a book does something\nlike that for me I think it's an extraordinary\n148\n00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:33,620\nand wonderful experience.\n149\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,870\nI'm grateful I got the opportunity to read\nand read it to you.\n",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:05,760\nHello, and welcome to the Screen Actors Guild Foundation BookPALS.\n\n2\n00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,980\nMy name is Sean Astin and I played Sam in \"Lord of the Rings.\"\n\n3\n00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:25,150\nI love to read, especially to kids. I have a daughter whose name is Allie and she loves it when I read to her, and we both love lima beans. Hmm.\n\n4\n00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:38,580\nThe story I'm going to read to you is called \"A Bad Case of Stripes,\" written and illustrated by David Shannon. Allie loves this book. I hope you do too.\n\n5\n00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:55,480\nCamilla Cream loved lima beans, but she never ate them. All of her friends hated lima beans and she wanted to fit in.\n\n6\n00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:04,240\nCamilla was always worried about what other people thought of her. Today she was fretting even more than usual.\n\n7\n00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:11,820\nIt was the first day of school and she couldn't decide what to wear. There were so many people to impress.\n\n8\n00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:22,190\nShe tried on forty-two outfits but none seemed quite right. She put on a pretty red dress and looked into the mirror.\n\n9\n00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:33,000\nAnd then she screamed. Her mother ran into the room, and she screamed too. \"Oh my heavens,\" she cried, \"You're completely covered with stripes!\"\n\n10\n00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,080\nThis was certainly true. Camilla was striped from head to toe. S he looked like a rainbow.\n\n11\n00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:48,760\nMrs. Cream felt Camilla's forehead.\n\"Do you feel alright?\" she asked.\n\"I feel fine,\" Camilla answered. \"But just look at me.\"\n\n12\n00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,260\n\"You get back in bed this instant!\" Her mother ordered. \"You're not going to school today!\"\n\n13\n00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,920\nCamilla was relieved. She didn't want to miss the first day of school, but she was afraid of what the other kids might say.\n\n14\n00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,880\nShe had no idea what to wear with those crazy stripes.\n\n15\n00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,440\nThat afternoon, Dr. Bumble came to examine Camilla. \"Most extraordinary!\" he exclaimed. \"I've never seen anything like it!\"\n\n16\n00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:28,340\n\"Are you having any coughing, sneezing, runny nose, aches, pains, chills, hot flashes, dizziness, drowsiness, shortness of breath, or uncontrollable twitching?\"\n\n17\n00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:39,720\n\"No,\" Camilla told him. \"I feel fine\".\n\"Well then,\" Dr. Bumble said, turning to Mrs. Cream. \"I don't see any reason why she shouldn't go to school tomorrow.\n\n18\n00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:50,969\nHere is some ointment that should help her clear up those stripes in a few days. If it doesn't, you know where to reach me.\" \nAnd off he went.\n\n19\n00:02:50,969 --> 00:03:02,609\nThe next day was a disaster. Everyone at school laughed at Camilla. They called her Camilla Crayon and Night of the Living Lollipop.\n\n20\n00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:15,280\nShe tried her best to act as if everything were normal. But when the class said the Pledge of Allegiance, her stripes turned red, white and blue, and she broke out in stars.\n\n21\n00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,400\nThe other kids thought this was great. One yelled out, \"Let's see some purple polka dots!\"\n\n22\n00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:30,160\nSure enough, Camilla turned all purple polka dots. Someone else shouted, \"Checkerboard!\" and a pattern of squares covered her skin.\n\n23\n00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:41,100\nSoon everyone was calling out different shapes and colors, and poor Camilla was changing faster than you can change channels on a TV.\n\n24\n00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:50,020\nThat night, Mr. Harms, the school principal, called.\n\"I'm sorry, Mrs. Cream,\" he said. \"I am going to have to ask you to keep Camilla home from school.\"\n\n25\n00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:58,760\nShe's just too much of a distraction, and I've been getting calls from the other parents. They're afraid those stripes may be contagious.\"\n\n26\n00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:08,880\nCamilla was so embarrassed. She couldn't believe that two days ago everyone liked her. Now, nobody wanted to be in the same room with her.\n\n27\n00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:17,000\nHer father tried to make her feel better.\n\"Is there anything I can get you, sweetheart?\" he asked.\n\n28\n00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:28,440\n\"No, thank you,\" sighed Camilla.\nWhat she really wanted was nice plate of lima beans, but she had been laughed at enough for one day.\n\n29\n00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:45,360\n\"Hmmm, well yes, I see,\" Dr. Bumble mumbled when Mr. Cream phoned the next day. \"I think I better bring in the specialists. We'll be right over.\"\n\n30\n00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,070\nAbout an hour later Dr. Bumble arrived with 4 people in long white coats.\n\n31\n00:04:50,070 --> 00:05:01,360\nHe introduced them to the Creams. \"This is Dr. Grop, Dr. Sponge, Dr. Cricket, and Dr. Young\".\nThen the specialists went to work on Camilla.\n\n32\n00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:11,860\nThey squeezed, jabbed, tapped, and tested. It was very uncomfortable.\n\"Well, it's not the mumps,\" concluded Dr. Grop.\n\n33\n00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:21,050\n\"Or the measles,\" said Dr. Sponge.\n\"Definitely not chicken pox,\" put in Dr. Cricket.\n\"Or sunburn,\" said Dr. Young.\n\n34\n00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:27,320\n\"Try these,\" said the specialists. They each handed her a bottle filled with different colored pills.\n\n35\n00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:34,620\n\"Take one of each before bed,\" said Dr. Grop.\nThen they filed out the front door, followed by Dr. Bumble.\n\n36\n00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:50,080\nThat night Camilla took her medicine. It was awful. When she woke up the next morning, she did feel different, but when she got dressed her clothes didn't fit right.\n\n37\n00:05:50,080 --> 00:06:03,040\nShe looked in the mirror and there staring back at her was a giant, multi-colored pill with her face on it.\n\n38\n00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:11,700\nDr. Bumble rushed over as soon as Mrs. Cream called, but this time instead of the specialists, he brought the experts.\n\n39\n00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:20,400\nDr. Gourd and Mr. Melon were the finest scientific minds in the land. Once again Camilla was poked and prodded, looked at and listened to.\n\n40\n00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,820\nThe experts wrote down lots of numbers and then they huddled together and whispered.\n\n41\n00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:36,020\nDr. Gourd finally spoke. \"It might be a virus,\" he announced with authority. Suddenly, funny little virus balls appeared all over Camilla.\n\n42\n00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,940\n\"Or possibly some form of bacteria,\" said Mr. Melon.\n\n43\n00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:52,040\nOut popped squiggly little bacteria tails.\n\"Or it could be a fungus,\" added Dr. Gourd. Instantly Camilla was covered with different colored fungus blotches.\n\n44\n00:06:52,040 --> 00:07:02,340\nThe experts looked at Camilla and then at each other. \"We need to go over the numbers again back at the lab,\" Dr. Gourd explained.\n\n45\n00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,180\n\"We'll call you when we know something.\" \nBut the experts didn't have a clue, much less a cure.\n\n46\n00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,240\nBy now the TV news had found out about Camilla.\n\n47\n00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,340\nReporters from every channel were outside her house telling the story of the bizarre case of the incredible changing kid.\n\n48\n00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,439\nSoon a huge crowd was camped out on the front lawn.\n\n49\n00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:33,020\nThe Creams were swamped with all kinds of remedies from psychologists, allergists, herbalists, nutritionists, psychics, an old medicine man,\n\n50\n00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,480\na guru and even a veterinarian.\n\n51\n00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,600\nEach so-called cure only added to poor Camilla's strange appearance, until it was hard to even recognize her.\n\n52\n00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:53,700\nShe sprouted roots and berries, crystals, feathers, and a long furry tail, but nothing worked.\n\n53\n00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:01,280\nOne day a woman who called herself an environmental therapist claimed she could cure Camilla.\n\n54\n00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:12,840\n\"Close your eyes,\" she said. \"Breathe deeply and become one with your room.\"\n\n55\n00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:23,360\n\"Oh, I wish you wouldn't have said that!\" Camilla groaned. Slowly she began to melt into the walls of her room.\n\n56\n00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:32,880\nHer bed became her mouth, her nose was a dresser, and two paintings were her eyes. The therapist screamed and ran from the house.\n\n57\n00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:42,860\n\"What are we going to do?\" cried Mrs. Cream.\n\"It just keeps getting worse and worse,\" she began to sob.\n\n58\n00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:48,920\nAt that moment Mr. Cream heard a quiet little knock at the front door.\n\n59\n00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,970\nHe opened it and there stood an old woman who was just as plump and sweet as a strawberry.\n\n60\n00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,260\n\"Uh, excuse me,\" she said brightly, \"but I think I can help.\"\n\n61\n00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,660\nShe went into Camilla's room and looked around.\n\"My goodness,\" she said with a shake of her head.\n\n62\n00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,000\n\"What we have here is a bad case of stripes, one of the worst I have ever seen.\"\n\n63\n00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:25,720\nShe pulled a container of small green beans from her bag. \"Here,\" she said, \"These might do the trick.\"\n\"Are those magic beans?\" asked Mrs. Cream.\n\n64\n00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:37,500\n\"Oh my, no,\" replied the kind old woman. \"There's no such thing. These are just plain old lima beans. I bet you'd like some, wouldn't you?\" she asked Camilla.\n\n65\n00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:52,120\nCamilla wanted a big heaping plate full of lima beans more than just about anything, but she was still afraid to admit it. \"Yuck,\" she said, \"no one likes lima beans, especially me.\"\n\n66\n00:09:52,120 --> 00:10:03,380\n\"Oh dear,\" the old woman said sadly. \"I guess I was wrong about you.\" She put the beans back in her bag and started toward the door.\n\n67\n00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:09,960\nCamilla watched the old woman walk away. Those beans would taste so good.\n\n68\n00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:15,480\nBeing laughed at for eating them was nothing compared to what she'd been going through.\n\n69\n00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:23,880\nShe finally couldn't stand it. \"Wait!\" she cried. \"The truth is that I really love lima beans.\"\n\n70\n00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:36,800\n\"I thought so,\" the old woman said with a smile. She took a handful of beans and popped them into Camilla's mouth.\n\n71\n00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,080\n\"Mmmm\" said Camilla. Suddenly the branches, feathers, and squiggly tails began to disappear,\n\n72\n00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:53,660\nthen the whole room swirled around. When it stopped, there stood Camilla, and everything was back to normal.\n\n73\n00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,590\n\"I'm cured!\" she shouted.\n\n74\n00:10:55,590 --> 00:11:08,960\n\"Yes,\" said the old woman. \"I knew the real you was in there somewhere.\"\nShe patted Camilla on the head, then she went outside and vanished into the crowd.\n\n75\n00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,380\nAfterward Camilla wasn't quite the same. Some of the kids at school said she was weird, but she didn't care a bit.\n\n76\n00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:24,530\nShe ate all the lima beans she wanted, and she never had even a touch of stripes again.\n\n77\n00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:34,620\nWell, pretty good right? I liked it, my daughter likes it, and we like lima beans.\n\n78\n00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:45,240\nSo I don't know about you, but if you can get a hold of some of these things... well, books, lima beans, whatever, I recommend it.",

awful,\" said Leslie, biting into her  baloney sandwich.\n\n87\n00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,400\n\"A real bummer,\" said Natie, chomping on his peanut butter and jelly.\n\n88\n00:04:12,720 -->

green.\n\n186\n00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400\nIt was not slimy or lumpy\n\n187\n00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,880\nand nothing was oozing out the sides.\n\n188\n00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,620\n\"So, what

--> 00:02:45,820\nThe captain handed her a hankie.\n\n54\n00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,820\n“Thank you,” sniffled Miss Rabbit.\n\n55\n00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,360\n“When did all this happen?” I asked.\n\n56\n00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,740\n“Probably between 8:00 and 10:00 this morning.”\n\n57\n00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,900\n“Any guess who might have done this?” I probed.\n\n58\n00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,100\nI noticed Miss Rabbit was wiping frosting\noff of her pajamas, whiskers, and nose.\n\n59\n00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,820\nShe clearly hadn’t had time\nfor her morning bath.\n\n60\n00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,640\n“No!” wailed Miss Rabbit.\n\n61\n00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,420\n“I don’t have a crumb of an idea!”\n\n62\n00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,080\nThe captain pointed to the window in the distance.\n\n63\n00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,920\nFowler the Owl was reading\nthe newspaper in her maple tree.\n\n64\n00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,640\nEveryone on the farm knew that Fowler liked\nrabbits.\n\n65\n00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,060\nShe liked them for breakfast.\n\n66\n00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,560\nShe liked them for lunch.\n\n67\n00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,640\nShe loved them for dinner.\n\n68\n00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,750\n“Does Fowler come around here?” I asked.\n\n69\n00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,030\n“No, she won’t mess with me.\n\n70\n00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,180\nI have a black belt in karate!” said Miss\nRabbit with a quick chop of her hind legs.\n\n71\n00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,020\n“And ma’am, whom did you invite to the\nparty?”\n\n72\n00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,020\n“Porcini and Hot Dog.\n\n73\n00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,900\nYou don’t think either of them is the thief,\ndo you?”\n\n74\n00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,580\n“Too soon to tell.”\n\n75\n00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,239\nI snapped shut the cover of my notepad.\n\n76\n00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,069\nThe captain checked the door.\n\n77\n00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,269\nI checked the windows.\n\n78\n00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:56,460\nThere was no sign of a break-in.\n\n79\n00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,080\nCould it be an inside job?\n\n80\n00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,760\n“Does anyone have a key to your rabbit hole?” I asked.\n\n81\n00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,860\nMiss Rabbit shook her head, sending crumbs\nand frosting flying.\n\n82\n00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,959\n“One last question. \nWhere were you when the cake was taken?”\n\n83\n00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,280\n“I was taking a quick catnap.”\n\n84\n00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,580\nHmm... a catnap.\n\n85\n00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,269\nSuch an odd thing for a bunny to do.\n\n86\n00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,030\nI taped off the crime scene.\n\n87\n00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,720\nThe captain dusted for prints and took photos.\n\n88\n00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,300\nThis case was going to be a hard nut to crack.\n\n89\n00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,760\nA hard nut indeed.\n\n90\n00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,840\nChapter 3: Suspects and Clues\n\n91\n00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,600\n11:00 am, Fowler’s Maple Tree\n\n92\n00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,220\nSuspect #1\n\n93\n00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,240\n“Hoo-hoo,” said Fowler, peeking her head\nout of her hole.\n\n94\n00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,300\n“What brings you two tasty treats to my\ntree?”\n\n95\n00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,699\n“Investigating a case,” I said, holding\nup my badge.\n\n96\n00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,040\n“Detective Wilcox and Captain Griswold,\nMFIs.\n\n97\n00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,940\nWhere were you between 8:00 and 10:00 this\nmorning?”\n\n98\n00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,520\n“I was chasing a field mouse.”\n\n99\n00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,500\n“Do you have any witnesses?”\n\n100\n00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,400\nIf someone had seen her, she’d have an alibi.\n\n101\n00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,620\n“There was one, but I ate him.”\n\n102\n00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,830\nThe captain shot her his\n“don’t-mess-with-this-mouse” look.\n\n103\n00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,060\nI shot her mine.\n\n104\n00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,840\n“You know it’s 30 years behind bars if\nyou eat an officer on this farm,” I warned.\n\n105\n00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,060\n“You don’t want to be a jailbird now,\ndo you?”\n\n106\n00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:28,460\n“Of course not!\n\n107\n00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,460\nBesides, I like my meals tender.\n\n108\n00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,740\nEveryone knows MFIs are too hardboiled to\nmake good eats.”\n\n109\n00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,610\nI chose to ignore that last comment.\n\n110\n00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:44,940\nThe captain glared at her with his\n“I’ll-show-you-who’s-hardboiled” look.\n\n111\n00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,780\n“Your tree faces Miss Rabbit’s hole.\n\n112\n00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:52,069\nHave you seen anyone come or go from \nMiss Rabbit’s in the last four hours?”\n\n113\n00:05:52,069 --> 00:05:54,680\n“Just Miss Rabbit and the two of you.\n\n114\n00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,140\nWhat’s this all about anyway?” asked Fowler.\n\n115\n00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,070\n“A cake,” I said.\n\n116\n00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,560\n“A rabbit cake?” asked Fowler.\n\n117\n00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,160\n“I love rabbit cake, especially with mouse\nfrosting.”\n\n118\n00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680\nI scowled. “No, a carrot cake.”\n\n119\n00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,860\n“I don’t know anything about a missing\ncarrot cake.”\n\n120\n00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,520\nFowler fluffed up her feathers, all innocent-like.\n\n121\n00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600\n“I didn’t say it was missing.”\n\n122\n00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,460\n“You wouldn’t be here if it were found,”\nsaid Fowler.\n\n123\n00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,479\n“Tell us what you know.”\n\n124\n00:06:25,480 --> 00:0The Case of the Missing Carrot Cake",

		"text"		: "1\n00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,360\nWelcome to Storyline Online\nbrought to you by the SAG-AFTRA Foundation\n\n2\n00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:14,080\nI'm Chrissy Metz and today I'm going to be reading \nThe Elves and the Shoemaker\n\n3\n00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,300\nThis is retold from the Brothers Grimm \nand illustrated by Jim LaMarche.\n\n4\n00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,460\nThere was once a good shoemaker who, through a spell of bad luck, had become very poor.\n\n5\n00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,700\nFinally, he had just enough leather to make one last pair of shoes.\n\n6\n00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,700\n“Still, it is a fine piece of leather,” said his wife, “as soft as butter, yet as strong as your hands.”\n\n7\n00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,860\n“Tonight, dear wife, I will cut the leather,” said the shoemaker,\n\n8\n00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,660\n“and first thing in the morning I will sew the shoes.”\n\n9\n00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:53,080\nThe next morning,when the couple went into the workshop,\n\n10\n00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,020\nthey were flabbergasted by what they found.\n\n11\n00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,500\nThere on the worktable stood two shoes—\n\n12\n00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,760\nperfectly finished, not a stitch out of place.\n\n13\n00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,560\n“But... but who? how?” sputtered the shoemaker.\n\n14\n00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,980\nHis wife could only stare.\n\n15\n00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,840\nJust then a dandy gentleman came into the shop.\n\n16\n00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,420\n“What magnificent shoes. Please, I must try them on,” he said.\n\n17\n00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,760\nThe shoes fit perfectly. It was as if they had been made just for him.\n\n18\n00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,660\nHe was so pleased that he paid double the price.\n\n19\n00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,520\nNow the shoemaker had enough money to buy leather for two more pairs of shoes.\n\n20\n00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:39,940\nAgain that evening, the shoemaker cut out the leather for\nthe shoes and went to bed.\n\n21\n00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,000\nAnd once again, in the morning, there were the shoes—finished!\n\n22\n00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,220\nBuyers were not lacking for these either,\n\n23\n00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,660\nand as before, they were so pleased, they paid double the price.\n\n24\n00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,080\nNow the shoemaker had enough money to buy leather for four more pairs of shoes.\n\n25\n00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,160\nThe next morning, just as before, there were the shoes already made.\n\n26\n00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,620\nOn and on it went.\n\n27\n00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,260\nWhatever the shoemaker cut out in the evening was finished by morning.\n\n28\n00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,260\nSoon the news of the splendid shoes spread throughout the town,\n\n29\n00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,120\nand the shoemaker and his wife were no longer poor.\n\n30\n00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,680\nOne evening, not long before Christmas, as the shoemaker cut more leather for shoes, his wife spoke.\n\n31\n00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,360\n“Dear husband, who has made us so rich?\n\n32\n00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,040\nWhat if we were to stay up tonight and see who\ncomes to our shop?”\n\n33\n00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440\nThe shoemaker agreed.\n\n34\n00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:47,240\nSo that night they lit a small lamp in the hall, hid behind their coats and waited.\n\n35\n00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,800\nAs the clock struck midnight, they heard the creak of a window and the scuttle of small feet.\n\n36\n00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:00,560\nPeeking out from behind the coats,they saw two tiny children sneak into the workshop.\n\n37\n00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,380\nThey were poorly shod, and they wore only raggedy sacks for warmth.\n\n38\n00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,120\n“Elves!” the shoemaker’s wife whispered.\n\n39\n00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,500\nThe tiny elves tiptoed across the room and climbed up onto the table.\n\n40\n00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,120\nThen, humming and whistling, they began to stitch and\nsew and hammer so quickly with their little fingers\n\n41\n00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,500\nthat the shoemaker and his wife could not believe their eyes.\n\n42\n00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,060\nThe elves did not stop until all the shoes were finished and stood lined up on the table:\n\n43\n00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,380\nsturdy riding boots, delicate slippers,\nfeather-light dancing shoes and heavy clogs for work.\n\n44\n00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:46,740\nThen the elves tiptoed out of the workshop, up the stairs and out the window.\n\n45\n00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,060\nThe next morning the wife said, “The little elves have made us rich,\n\n46\n00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,940\nwe must give them something in return.\n\n47\n00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,020\nThey run around with so little on they must be freezing.\n\n48\n00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,900\nI will make a warm dress, coat and pants, and knit them each a pair of stockings.”\n\n49\n00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,780\n“And I shall be happy to make them each a pair of fine shoes,” said the shoemaker.\n\n50\n00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,360\nThey went right to work, and that evening they laid the presents on the worktable.\n\n51\n00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,820\nThen, like before, they hid behind the coats and waited.\n\n52\n00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,740\nAt midnight, the elves quietly slipped into the shop ready for another night’s work.\n\n53\n00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,940\nBut instead of pieces of leather, they found beautiful presents.\n\n54\n00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,860\nAt first they were too astonished to move.\n\n55\n00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,660\nThen they hugged their new warm clothes and quickly put them on.\n\n56\n00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,640\nWhen they were dressed, they leaped and bounced around the room, singing,\n\n57\n00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,200\n“Now we’re elves so fine to see,\nno longer cobblers we will be.”\n\n58\n00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,500\nThey jumped over chairs, raced around the shop and finally ran out the door.\n\n59\n00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,120\nThe click and clack of their new shoes echoed through\nthe streets.\n\n60\n00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:59,460\nFrom that time on, the little elves were not seen again.\n\n61\n00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,380\nBut the shoemaker and his wife lived a long and happy life.\n\n62\n00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,580\nThe End.\n\n63\n00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,000\nSo I love this book because I think it is really important that we give and we receive\n\n64\n00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,500\nand I think as the elves gave so kindly to the shoemaker and his wife\n\n65\n00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,000\nto make sure that they lived a long and happy life they in turn gave\n\n66\n00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,380\nall the clothing to the elves and then the elves could go and help other people\n\n67\n00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,760\nand I think that it's really important to give with your whole heart.\n\n68\n00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,340\nThank you so much for watching Storyline Online\n\n69\n00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,320\nand make sure you watch all of our stories.\n\n70\n00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320\nKeep watching and keep reading!",

It's really fun.\n\n7\n00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,700\nIn Alaska, in winter, we have to watch out for moose.\n\n8\n00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:47,100\nWe have to look both ways when we go out the door, making sure there are no moose around.\n\n9\n00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,900\nThat's because moose are very big, and they\nkick things that surprise them or make them angry.\n\n10\n00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,300\nTheir big kicks are strong enough to dent a car.\n\n11\n00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,760\nMy mother drives slowly in the winter, looking out for moose.\n\n12\n00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,880\nWhen my friends and I are playing outside\n\n13\n00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,330\nand a moose comes along, we have to hug a tree.\n\n14\n00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,260\nA moose can't step on you or knock you over if you're hugging a tree.\n\n15\n00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,820\nAlso, during winter in Alaska, it's dark.\nNot just at night for sleeping, but almost all the time.\n\n16\n00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,860\nIt doesn't get light until it's already snack time at school,\n\n17\n00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,500\nand it's dark again practically\nright after lunch. Daytime is only five hours long.\n\n18\n00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:30,149\nAnd sometimes, when there's so much\nsnow that it covers up the windows,\n\n19\n00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,580\ndaylight  can barely peek in.\n\n20\n00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,200\nAlaska snow piles up everywhere.\n\n21\n00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,340\nIt gets so deep that the moose with their skinny legs have trouble walking in it.\n\n22\n00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,020\nThey like to use  people's shoveled driveways and paths.\n\n23\n00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,940\nThat's why a moose lives in our backyard.\n\n24\n00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,400\nHe wandered up our driveway, found a good spot where he could nibble at our trees, and decided to stay.\n\n25\n00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,760\nHe sleeps in our yard and eats our trees.\n\n26\n00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,730\nI try throwing carrots to him, even cookies,\nbut he really likes the tree with my blue swing on it.\n\n27\n00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,860\nI'm worried about my swing.\n\n28\n00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,090\nOnce, we saw a moose walking around town with\na swing in his antlers.\n\n29\n00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,160\nHe'd gotten tangled and just tore the whole\nswing away.\n\n30\n00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,140\nI think the dark and that moose are making\nme kind of grumpy,\n\n31\n00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,960\nbecause even Hanukkah hasn't cheered me up.\n\n32\n00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,900\nMy friends and I pretend to be dreidels spinning in the snow,\n\n33\n00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,000\nand when the mail lady comes, she always has another present for me from my aunts and uncles Outside.\n\n34\n00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,920\n(Do you know that everywhere else from Alaska is called \"Outside\"?)\n\n35\n00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,720\nBut every time I light a new candle in our menorah,\n\n36\n00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,050\nI look out the window and it's still\ndark, and that moose is still there, too close\n\n37\n00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,560\nto my swing and eating our trees.\nMy mother and I throw some apples, hoping\n\n38\n00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,180\nhe'll like them instead, but he just watches\nthem fall and eats more tree.\n\n39\n00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,140\nOne night as I am lighting the last Hanukkah\ncandle, my father says, \"Let's go outside.\n\n40\n00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,909\nI have something to show you.\"\n\"With the moose there?\"\n\n41\n00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:17,189\n\"Don't worry, we'll stay far away.\"\n\n42\n00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,840\nI put on my long underwear and two layers of socks.\n\n43\n00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,620\nI put on my thick, baggy pants...\n...and a sweatshirt. I put a snowsuit on over all that,\n\n44\n00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:35,240\ntwo layers of mittens, and a hat.\nStill, it's freezing cold outside, and it's very dark,\n\n45\n00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,110\nand I do not like being anywhere\nnear that moose.\n\n46\n00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,280\nI want that moose away from my swing!\n\n47\n00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,600\n\"Dad, what are we waiting for?\"\n\n48\n00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:53,420\n\"Just wait. You'll see.\" But he's looking\nat the sky. I'm looking at that moose.\n\n49\n00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,839\nMom says, \"Maybe we can try some fresh spinach.\nMaybe he'll leave your swing alone for something green.\"\n\n50\n00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,019\nBut the spinach doesn't work, and I'm freezing.\n\n51\n00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,540\nDad says, \"This is a perfect night. You'll see.\"\n\n52\n00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:11,190\nSuddenly, dad points up to the sky.\n\n53\n00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,440\nThere are pink and purple and orange ribbons of light!\n\n54\n00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,120\nThe sky is full of color, all swirling\nand shining and glowing.\n\n55\n00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,160\nAgainst the dark black of the sky, the lights\nare bright and beautiful.\n\n56\n00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,120\nI have never seen anything like this.\n\n57\n00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,080\nSo much light, and so big. Filling the sky,                coloring the sky.\n\n58\n00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,350\nA rainbow on black velvet.\n\n59\n00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,639\n\"They're called the northern lights,\" Dad says.\n\n60\n00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:49,540\n\"Aurora borealis. They happen especially up here in Alaska, but only when the sky is just right.\n\n61\n00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,300\nOur very own Hanukkah Festival of Lights.\"\n\n62\n00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,460\nIt looks like ribbons of wax,\n\n63\n00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,620\nall the candles from all the menorahs, melting into the dark, lighting it up.\n\n64\n00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,780\nI stare at those lights.\n\n65\n00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,220\nI stare so hard, I don't even notice the moose sticking his  head through my swing.\n\n66\n00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,500\nNext thing I know, the moose is yanking on the chain,\n\n67\n00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,820\npulling on the whole tree.\n\n68\n00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,700\nCREAK! CLANK! SNORT! <Audio swinging swing, cracking tree, snorting moose and bellow>\n\n69\n00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,550\nI can't stand it. That moose will tear everything up.\n\n70\n00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,759\nBut then I have an idea. I run into the house\nand run back outside with my hands full.\n\n71\n00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,340\nI wave what I have at the moose, and he sniffs,\nturning his head away from the swing.\n\n72\n00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,289\nI back up, laying what I have down in the\nsnow. The moose stretches his head, reaches for it.\n\n73\n00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,980\nI keep backing up, laying more down,\nand the moose follows me!\n\n74\n00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:54,200\nOut of the yard, down the driveway, AWAY! I lay the last batch down and race back into our yard.\n\n75\n00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:04,920\nI look at the sky, at the lights. I'm so happy\nto see those lights. I'm so happy that moose is gone.\n\n76\n00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,760\nMy parents are surprised. \"What did\nyou feed him?\" they ask. \"What did he like so much?\"\n\n77\n00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,919\n\"Latkes,\" I answer.\n\n78\n00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,000\nHanukkah can be pretty funny in Alaska,\n\n79\n00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,380\nand miracles can happen in a lot of different ways.\n\n80\n00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,480\nAnd that's the end.\n\n81\n00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,280\nIf you've never had latkes,\n\n82\n00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:41,389\nyou have to try them. They're pancakes, but\nthey're made out of potatoes.\n\n83\n00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,860\nBut make sure you have a grown-up to help you out because you have to use very hot oil.\n\n84\n00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,420\nMy dad makes them with zucchini, so they are a little healthier. They are really tasty.",

Brought to you\nby the SAG-AFTRA Foundation.\n\n2\n00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:14,070\nI'm Ed O'Neill and today I'll be reading How\nI Learned Geography written and illustrated\n\n3\n00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,630\nby Uri Shulevitz.\n\n4\n00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,660\nWhen war devastated the land,\n\n5\n00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,180\nbuildings crumbled to dust.\n\n6\n00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:31,260\nEverything we had was lost, and we fled empty-handed. We traveled far, far east to another country,\n\n7\n00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:39,290\nwhere summer were hot and winters were cold,\nto a city of houses made of clay, straw, and camel dung,\n\n8\n00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,120\nsurrounded by dusty steppes, burned\nby the sun.\n\n9\n00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,200\nWe lived in a small room with a couple we\ndid not know.\n\n10\n00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,359\nWe slept on a dirt floor.\n\n11\n00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:54,449\nI had no toys and no books.\n\n12\n00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,349\nWorst of all: food was scarce.\n\n13\n00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,580\nOne day, Father went to the bazaar to buy\nbread.\n\n14\n00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,659\nAs evening approached, he hadn't returned.\n\n15\n00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:10,689\nMother and I were worried and hungry.\n\n16\n00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:13,810\nIt was nearly dark when he came home.\n\n17\n00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,430\nHe carried a long roll of paper under his\narm.\n\n18\n00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,680\n\"I bought a map,\" he announced triumphantly.\n\n19\n00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,579\n\"Where is the bread?\"\n\n20\n00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:24,590\nMother asked.\n\n21\n00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,700\n\"I had enough money to buy only a tiny piece\nof bread, and we would still be hungry,\"\n\n22\n00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,890\nhe explained apologetically.\n\n23\n00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,200\n\"No supper tonight,\" Mother said bitterly.\n\n24\n00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,850\n\"We'll have the map instead.\"\n\n25\n00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,570\nI was furious.\n\n26\n00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,120\nI didn't think I would ever forgive him, and\nI went to bed hungry, while the couple we\n\n27\n00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,030\nlived with ate their meager supper.\n\n28\n00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,360\nThe husband was a writer.\n\n29\n00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,420\nHe write in silence, but, oh!\n\n30\n00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,740\nhow loudly he\nchewed.\n\n31\n00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,619\nHe chewed a small crust of bread as if it\nwere the most delicious morsel in the world.\n\n32\n00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,220\nI envied him his bread and wished I were the\none chew it.\n\n33\n00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:10,300\nI covered my head with my blanket so I would\nnot hear him smacking his lips with such noisy delight.\n\n34\n00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,590\nThe next day father hung the map.\n\n35\n00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,760\nIt took up an entire wall.\n\n36\n00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,160\nOur cheerless room was flooded with color.\n\n37\n00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,010\nI became fascinated by the map and spent long\nhours looking at it, studying its every detail,\n\n38\n00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,290\nand many days drawing it on any scrap of paper\nthat chanced my way.\n\n39\n00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,770\nI found strange-sounding names on the map\nand savored their exotic sounds,\n\n40\n00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:42,659\nmaking a little rhyme out of them: Fukuoka Takaoka\nomsk, Fukuyama Nagayama Tomsk, Okazaki Miyazaki\n\n41\n00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:46,060\nPinks, Pennsylvania Transylvania Minsk!\n\n42\n00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,660\nI repeated this rhyme like a magic incantation\nand was transported far away\n\n43\n00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,560\nwithout ever leaving our room.\n\n44\n00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,360\nI landed in burning deserts.\n\n45\n00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,349\nI ran on beaches and felt their sand between\nmy toes.\n\n46\n00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:05,650\nI Climbed snowy mountains where icy winds\nlicked my face.\n\n47\n00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,810\nI saw wondrous temples where stone carving\ndanced on the walls,\n\n48\n00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,159\nand birds of all colors sang on the rooftops.\n\n49\n00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,690\nI pass through fruit groves eating as many\npapayas and mangos as I pleased.\n\n50\n00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:25,050\nI drank fresh water and rested in the shade\nof palm trees.\n\n51\n00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:32,490\nI cam to a city of tall buildings and counted\nzillions of windows, falling asleep before I could finish.\n\n52\n00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:40,190\nAnd so I spent enchanted hours far, far from\nour hunger and misery.\n\n53\n00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,680\nI forgave my father.\n\n54\n00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,720\nHe was right, after all.\n\n55\n00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,760\nYou know, I like this story because it took\nthe boy out of his desprate situation to other\n\n56\n00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,720\nworlds that he enjoyed so much more.\n\n57\n00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,019\nIt reminds me of when I was a boy of twelve.\n\n58\n00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:05,980\nI discovered an author by the name of Mark\nTwain and the name of the book was Huckleberry\n\n59\n00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,570\nFinn and it took me down the Mississippi River\nand lots of adventures that I wouldn't normally\n\n60\n00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,110\nhave had in Youngstown Ohio.\n\n61\n00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,880\nReading can do that for you.\n\n62\n00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,980\nIt can take you to other worlds, other places,\n\n63\n00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,500\nother experiences that you would never normally have.\n\n64\n00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,550\nThank you

And then I feel it comin' on. The itch. The Hula-Hoopin' itch.\n\n8\n00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,380\nMy fingers start snappin', and my feet start tappin'. My hips start swingin',\n\n9\n00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,720\nand I'm just reachin' for a hoop when Mama says...\n\n10\n00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,940\n\"Girl, don't you even think about it. You know today is Miz Adeline's birthday.\"\n\n11\n00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,940\nHeat washes up over me, and I stamp my foot. Don't get me wrong. I love Miz Adeline.\n\n12\n00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:16,940\nShe lives right next door. Miz Adeline took care of Mama when she was little, and she took care of me too.\n\n13\n00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,800\nShe's like my very own grandmama.\n\n14\n00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:30,260\n\"But, Mama,\" I burst out. \"I can't help with Miz Adeline's party. I'm supposed to meet Jamara. Today's the day...\"\n\n15\n00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:39,080\nMama stands as still as water in a puddle. She gives me her look. Then she hands me a broom.\n\n16\n00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,960\nI sigh loudly and start sweeping.\n\n17\n00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:51,940\nBut when Mama's not watching, I push my favorite hoop a little closer to the door with my toe.\n\n18\n00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,840\nMama and I dust every room and scrub down the floors.\n\n19\n00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,460\nWe polish each window 'til we can see clear to New Jersey.\n\n20\n00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,860\nAfter that I peel potatoes while Mama starts mixing up her special double-fudge chocolate cake.\n\n21\n00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:14,540\n\"Kameeka, set the oven to 350 degrees,\" Mama says as she empties the last of the sugar into the mixing bowl.\n\n22\n00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,400\n\"And add sugar to the grocery list.\"\n\n23\n00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,740\nI push the button on the oven and look out the window. It's already getting late.\n\n24\n00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,640\nI bet Jamara's telling everybody I'm too scared to hoop her.\n\n25\n00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,400\nWhile the cake bakes, we make up plates of fancy sandwiches.\n\n26\n00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,000\nThen Mama slices strawberries and shows me how to make whipped cream.\n\n27\n00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:41,200\nWhen the timer rings, Mama opens the oven.\n\n28\n00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,080\n\"Kameeka!\" Mama yells as she checks the oven temperature. \"You only set it to 250 degrees!\"\n\n29\n00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,100\nMiz Adeline's birthday cake looks like someone sat on it. Mama says we'll have to start over.\n\n30\n00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,580\nMama sends me to the store to buy more sugar.\n\n31\n00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:08,140\nOn my way out the door, I grab a hoop like I usually do, but when I get outside, I remember that I'm on a mission.\n\n32\n00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,740\nMiz Adeline's party will be starting in a couple of hours.\n\n33\n00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:16,500\nMama has to finish the potato salad, and we still have to make another cake.\n\n34\n00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,420\nI don't even twirl my hoop as I hurry down the street.\n\n35\n00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:26,100\nI don't stop to blow kisses to Miss Evelyn or wave to Mr. John in the bakery.\n\n36\n00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:36,500\nI'm coming out of the store when I see Jamara and Portia hoopin' on the corner of 139th and Broadway.\n\n37\n00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,800\n\"We thought you weren't coming, Kameeka,\" says Jamara with a smirk.\n\n38\n00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,160\nI need to get the sugar back to Mama, but Jamara sounds so smug I can't stand it.\n\n39\n00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,900\n\"Well, you thought wrong,\" I tell her.\n\"You ready?\" she asks.\n\n40\n00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280\n\"I was born ready.\"\n\n41\n00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,900\nAnd then I feel it comin' on. The itch. The Hula-Hoopin' itch.\n\n42\n00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,300\n\"Whoever hoops the longest is the winner,\" Portia says.\n\n43\n00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,700\nAs soon as she shouts \"Go!\" my fingers start snappin' and my feet start tappin'.\n\n44\n00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,340\nMy hips start swingin', and I just know I'm gonna beat Jamara today.\n\n45\n00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:23,440\nNeighborhood kids crowd around as Jamara and I hoop. Cars honk and slow down.\n\n46\n00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:29,980\nTrucks roar past, throwing up heat and dust from the pavement. Swish, swiggle, swish.\n\n47\n00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,600\nJamara frowns. \"You've been practicing some,\" she says.\n\n48\n00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,800\n\"That's right, girl.\" A grin greater than the Brooklyn Bridge stretches across my face.\n\n49\n00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:49,800\nThe sun moves between the buildings, and the sidewalk starts cooling down, but Jamara and me keep on hoopin'.\n\n50\n00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,020\n\"I've got doughnuts for Miz Adeline's party,\" Mr. John calls out as he closes up the bakery.\n\n51\n00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,360\nSwish, swiggle, swish, swiggle.\n\n52\n00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,040\n\"Miz Adeline's cake!\" I shout.\n\n53\n00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,640\nMy hoop clatters to the sidewalk. I grab it and the sugar, and race up the block.\n\n54\n00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,440\nI can hear Jamara laughing behind me.\n\n55\n00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:18,660\nBy the time I reach our apartment, Mama is madder than a hornet. \"Kameeka Hayes!\" she scolds.\n\n56\n00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,580\n\"I'm sorry, Mama. I saw Jamara and--\"\n\n57\n00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:31,260\n\"Girl, I don't want to hear that Hula-Hoopin' nonsense. It's too late now. Miz Adeline's already here.\n\n58\n00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,540\nYou take yourself on into the living room and explain to Miz Adeline why she won't have cake for her birthday.\"\n\n59\n00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,840\nMiz Adeline brought her own music, and she's got it turned up loud.\n\n60\n00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:53,760\nShe's sitting and listening to a jazzy blues tune, noddin' her head like a spring robin looking for a worm.\n\n61\n00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:01,880\n\"Hi, Miz Adeline,\" I say. \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\"Kameeka, come here, baby. Give me a kiss.\"\n\n62\n00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,780\nI come in close and kiss Miz Adeline's soft cheek.\n\n63\n00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:14,640\nThen I whisper in her ear, \"You don't really like cake much, do you?\"\n\n64\n00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:24,320\n\"Baby girl, you know I sure do love cake. Chocolate cake with strawberries and real whipped cream on top.\"\n\n65\n00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,420\nShe pats my arm. \"Oh yes, that is my favorite cake.\" Miz Adeline smiles at me.\n\n66\n00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,400\nI try to smile back, but my heart is racing as fast as the roller coaster at Coney Island.\n\n67\n00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,860\nI can't tell her about the cake just yet.\n\n68\n00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,200\nPretty soon the neighbors start arriving.\n\n69\n00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:51,740\nMiss Evelyn's wearing her Sunday church hat, and Mr. John's all spruced up in a pin-striped suit.\n\n70\n00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,140\nJamara and Portia sashay in with their parents. They're still carrying their hoops from earlier today.\n\n71\n00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:05,640\n\"Girls, I don't want to see any hoops,\" says Mama firmly to Jamara and Portia. \"Okay, Mrs. Hayes,\" says Jamara.\n\n72\n00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:12,760\nShe flashes her big, smirking smile at me. \"Kameeka, you're about done with hoopin' after today, aren't you?\"\n\n73\n00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,320\nI smile right back at her. \"Don't you bet on it, Jamara.\"\n\n74\n00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:26,980\nMost of the presents are still unopened when Miz Adeline says, \"Well, I do believe it's time for birthday cake.\"\n\n75\n00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,860\nI swallow hard.\n\n76\n00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:42,200\n\"Miz Adeline,\" I say slowly. \"We made a cake, but it didn't turn out right.\n\n77\n00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:50,540\nThen we needed more sugar to make another one, but I didn't get the sugar back to Mama in time 'cause I was hoopin'.\n\n78\n00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,620\nI was trying to beat Jamara so I could be the Hula-Hoopin' Queen of 139th Street.\n\n79\n00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,920\nIt's my fault there isn't any cake.\n\n80\n00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,920\n\"No cake?\" says Miz Adeline, raising her eyebrows.\n\n81\n00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,320\nI look over at Jamara. She's spinning one of Mr. John's doughnuts round and round on her finger like it's a Hula-Hoop.\n\n82\n00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,100\nSuddenly that gives me an idea.\n\n83\n00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,980\n\"I'll be right back,\" I yell as I race from the room.\n\n84\n00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:29,240\nIn the kitchen I set a chocolate doughnut on a pretty plate. I add whipped cream and strawberries.\n\n85\n00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,280\nMama comes in to help. I put a candle on top, and she lights it.\n\n86\n00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:46,840\nAs I carry the doughnut cake to Miz Adeline, Mama starts singing \"Happy Birthday,\" and everyone joins in.\n\n87\n00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,740\nThe candle glows as bright as the smile on Miz Adeline's face.\n\n88\n00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,820\n\"Why, this is just about perfect,\" Miz Adeline says, taking a bite of her doughnut birthday cake.\n\n89\n00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:06,300\n\"Now, Kameeka, did you say you were hoopin'? When I was a girl, I was the best Hula-Hooper on this block.\"\n\n90\n00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:16,160\n\"Adeline, don't you start that nonsense,\" Miss Evelyn says as she marches on over to us. \"You know very well I was the best.\"\n\n91\n00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:27,660\nMiz Adeline looks at me. \"Baby girl, why don't you bring some hoops on in here and let me show this old girl what she forgot.\"\n\n92\n00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,120\nMy eyes find Mama's. She shakes her head.\n\n93\n00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,900\nBut Miz Adeline's already pushing back chairs to make room. Then she slips a hoop over her head.\n\n94\n00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,240\nAnd right then I know.\n\n95\n00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,480\nMiz Adeline's just like me. She's got the itch. The Hula-Hoopin' itch.\n\n96\n00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,820\nHer fingers start snappin', and her feet start tappin.'\n\n97\n00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:00,760\nHer hips start swingin', and before we know it that hoop is swishin' right around Miz Adeline's waist.\n\n98\n00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,880\nThen she's got it swingin' around her neck.\n\n99\n00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,420\nI glance over at Mama and see a smile pulling at her lips in spite of herself.\n\n100\n00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:18,140\nMiz Adeline shimmies the hoop down past her knees.\n\n101\n00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:24,440\nShe spins it around her ankle as she hops on one foot, then the other.\n\n102\n00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,640\nWith the hoop still swishin' round and round, Miz Adeline heads for the door.\n\n103\n00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,640\nMiss Evelyn grabs one of my hoops, and Mr. John grabs another.\n\n104\n00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:41,580\nEven Mama's hips are swingin' as the whole party spills out on to the street.\n\n105\n00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,440\nEverybody's got the itch. The Hula-Hoopin' itch.\n\n106\n00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:52,980\nPretty soon hoops are swishin' and swingin' all the way down the block.\n\n107\n00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:02,420\n\"Kameeka, this is the best birthday party I've ever had!\" Miz Adeline hollers.\n\n108\n00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:11,080\nJamara hoops on over to me. \"Kameeka,\" she says. \"I know who the real Hula-Hoopin' Queen of 139th Street is.\"\n\n109\n00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,300\n\"I do too,\" I say.\n\n110\n00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:20,000\nJamara settles her hoop around her waist. \"You ready, Kameeka?\"\n\n111\n00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,940\n\"I was born ready,\" I say.\n\n112\n00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:30,620\nThe sidewalk is cooler than a spring rain, and the streetlights shine like stars.\n\n113\n00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,960\nSwish, swiggle, swish...\n\n114\n00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,360\nThe end.\n\n115\n00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:46,100\nWell, the reason I wanted to read this story to you all is because I love Hula Hoops so much,\n\n116\n00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:53,060\nand it was one of my favorite things to play with when I was a girl. And even now, as a full-grown adult,\n\n117\n00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,180\nI have my own Hula Hoop, I have actually several Hula Hoops,\n\n118\n00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,920\nand I have an emoji that is an avatar of myself with a Hula Hoop.\n\n119\n00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:10,860\nAnd whenever anything fun, or special, or really fantastic happens in my life,\n\n120\n00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:18,100\nI go out and I get my Hula Hoops and I swish, swiggle, swish.\n\n121\n00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,180\nThanks for watching Storyline Online.",

Lonnie Chavis.\n\n4\n00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,560\nI'm Mackenzie Hancsicsak.\n\n5\n00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,200\nAnd I'm Parker Bates.\n\n6\n00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,600\nAnd today, we are going to read\n\"If I Ran for President\"\n\n7\n00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,680\nwritten by Catherine Stier and illustrated\nby Lynne Avril Cravath.\n\n8\n00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,680\nIt would be great to run for president of\nthe United States!\n\n9\n00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,000\nIf I ran for president, \nI’d hope the people of the United States\n\n10\n00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,179\nwould choose me for a very important job—\nthe job of leading our country.\n\n11\n00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:35,240\nAnd I’d hope to follow in the footsteps\nof past presidents such as:\n\n12\n00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,520\nGeorge Washington, our first president,\n\n13\n00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,620\nThomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt,\nand Abraham Lincoln.\n\n14\n00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,940\nI’d have to think carefully about my decision\nto run for president.\n\n15\n00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,250\nI would want to know how my family felt about\nit, too.\n\n16\n00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:52,100\nThen I’d ask myself: “Am I the best person\nfor the job?\n\n17\n00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,960\nAm I ready to work \nVERY, VERY, VERY hard for my country?\n\n18\n00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,860\nDo lots of people\nbelieve in me, and will they help me run for office?”\n\n19\n00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,420\nIf I could answer yes to all those questions,\nthen I’d declare my candidacy.\n\n20\n00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:10,620\nThat means I’d announce I was interested\nin the job of president of the United States.\n\n21\n00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,860\nIf I ran for president, I’d run a campaign\nto let voters learn all about me.\n\n22\n00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,160\nPeople who thought I would be a good president\nwould donate money or time to help.\n\n23\n00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,200\nI’d hire people to work on my campaign, too.\n\n24\n00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,800\nCampaigns can make a candidate famous!\n\n25\n00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,080\nSoon my name or face would\nappear on signs,\n\n26\n00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,220\nbuttons, bumper stickers, and T-shirts!\n\n27\n00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,700\nI’d even star in television commercials.\n\n28\n00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,340\nIf I ran for president, \nI’d work with my political party—\n\n29\n00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,520\nthat’s a group of people who share the same beliefs\nabout how the country should be governed.\n\n30\n00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,180\nThey support candidates who\nuphold those ideas.\n\n31\n00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,640\nThe two major parties are the Democratic party\n(their symbol is a donkey)\n\n32\n00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,540\nand the Republican party \n(their symbol is an elephant).\n\n33\n00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,180\nThere are other parties, too, called “third\nparties.”\n\n34\n00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,020\nBut people besides me would want to be president.\n\n35\n00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,460\nThe Republican and Democratic parties must choose whom they’ll support in the election.\n\n36\n00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,640\nIn some states, like Iowa, the parties\neach hold meetings called caucuses (KAW-kuhs-uhs),\n\n37\n00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,200\nwhere members pick their favorite candidate.\n\n38\n00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,960\nIn most states, party members\nhold an election called a primary.\n\n39\n00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,380\nCaucuses and primaries show which candidates are popular with voters\n\n40\n00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,560\nand who might have the best chance\nof being elected president.\n\n41\n00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,300\nThe first primary is held in New Hampshire,\nin the winter before the presidential election.\n\n42\n00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,420\nI’d be sure to visit there—\nbut I’d have to bundle up!\n\n43\n00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:45,560\nIn the summer before the election, the political parties announce their candidate for president.\n\n44\n00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,360\nThe major parties make this announcement\nat meetings called conventions.\n\n45\n00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,580\nEach state sends delegates to the convention.\n\n46\n00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,000\nDelegates vote for the candidate who was most popular in their state.\n\n47\n00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:03,400\nA convention looks like a big celebration,\nfull of cheering and chanting, balloons and confetti.\n\n48\n00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,180\nMillions of Americans watch the excitement on TV.\n\n49\n00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,280\nBy the time of the convention, everyone usually knows which candidate will be chosen,\n\n50\n00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,400\nbut the delegates still hold a vote.\n\n51\n00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,560\nIf my party chose me to run for president,\n\n52\n00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,800\nI’d make a speech to get \neveryone excited about helping me win.\n\n53\n00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,560\nI’d tell the American people about my platform— \nmy plans and ideas for our country.\n\n54\n00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,880\nMy running mate would make a speech, too.\n\n55\n00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,460\nThat’s the person who’d be my\nvice-president if I became president.\n\n56\n00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,660\nIf I ran for president, I’d be invited to\ndebate with other presidential candidates.\n\n57\n00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,100\nA person called a moderator would ask us questions.\n\n58\n00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,220\nPeople across the country would listen \ncarefully to our answers.\n\n59\n00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,980\nReporters would ask me questions, too, \nabout my life, my family—\n\n60\n00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,180\neven my kitten, Sassy.\n\n61\n00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,820\nThey’d print old photographs of me in newspapers and magazines,\n\n62\n00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,040\nlike the snapshot of me in my superhero costume,\n\n63\n00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,820\nor my baby picture when I still wore diapers!\n\n64\n00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,140\nIf I ran for president, I would travel the\ncountry to meet lots of people.\n\n65\n00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,260\nI’d have my own campaign bus or airplane\nto take me from place to place.\n\n66\n00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,460\nInside there’d be comfy seats, perfect for\nchecking out the news,\n\n67\n00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,780\nwriting speeches, and thinking about how to solve the nation’s problems.\n\n68\n00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:24,560\nI’d take naps, too— I’d need the extra rest!\n\n69\n00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,480\nI’d work hard and be very busy!\n\n70\n00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,820\nAll in one week, I might share cereal\nwith kindergartners in California,\n\n71\n00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,300\ncrunch corn with farmers in Kansas,\n\n72\n00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,820\n...and have dinner in Delaware,\n\n73\n00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,740\nwhere I’d order the Blue Plate Special \nwith apple pie and a large strawberry milkshake.\n\n74\n00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,160\nAfter all that food, I might not feel too well!\n\n75\n00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,540\nStill, I’d have to smile and talk with the people I met.\n\n76\n00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,080\nPresidential candidates make lots of speeches, shake hands— and cuddle babies.\n\n77\n00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,300\nFinally, in November, Election Day would arrive.\n\n78\n00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,040\nIf I ran for president,\nI’d be nervous and excited!\n\n79\n00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,020\nOn Election Day, millions of voters from across the country go to their polling places to “cast their ballots.”\n\n80\n00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,880\nThat’s another way to say that they vote.\n\n81\n00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,500\nIn our country, people vote in private.\n\n82\n00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,340\nNo one but you knows how you voted,\n\n83\n00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,100\nbut I know I’d choose my favorite candidate— me!\n\n84\n00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,520\nOnce the voting is finished, officials count\nup the ballots.\n\n85\n00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,260\nThen comes the announcement on television, radio, in the newspapers, and on the Internet.\n\n86\n00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,100\nPeople everywhere find out\nwho will be the next president of the United States.\n\n87\n00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,380\nI’d stay up late and keep my fingers crossed.\n\n88\n00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240\nIf I ran for president and lost,\n\n89\n00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,540\nthe people who worked so hard on my campaign would be disappointed.\n\n90\n00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,160\nI’d be disappointed, too!\n\n91\n00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,580\nStill, I’d be proud that I had taken part in a free and fair election.\n\n92\n00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,240\nI’d make a telephone call to offer my best wishes and my support to the winner—\n\n93\n00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,520\nour next president!\n\n94\n00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,280\nBut if I won... WOW!\n\n95\n00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,280\nOn January 20th, I’d say the words of the\noath of office and be sworn in as president.\n\n96\n00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,840\nOn that day, my Inauguration Day, \nthere’d be a parade and a fancy ball!\n\n97\n00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400\nThen I’d move into the White House in Washington, D.C., to begin my four-year term\n\n98\n00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,200\nas the president of the United States of America.\n\n99\n00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,340\nAnd what would I do when I became president?\n\n100\n00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,120\nWell, that’s another story.\n\n101\n00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,400\nThe end!\n\n102\n00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,440\nI learned a lot from this book.\n\n103\n00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,920\nIt's not just about running for president,\nit's also about being a good citizen and voting.\n\n104\n00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,700\nYeah, I can't wait to turn eighteen to vote.\n\n105\n00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,460\nI'm going to register to vote when I'm seventeen\nso I'm ready to go.\n\n106\n00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,060\nIt's up to us to elect people who will represent\nus the best.\n\n107\n00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,640\nYeah, voting is super important.\n\n108\n00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100\nI go with my mom to the polls when she votes.\n\n109\n00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,540\nIt's a lot of fun too.\n\n110\n00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,760\nAnd as kids we have to remember we have a voice too.\n\n111\n00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,500\nEven though we can't vote yet we can still\nuse our voice to make change.\n\n112\n00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,640\nThat's true.\n\n113\n00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,120\nHey, thank you for watching Storyline Online.\n\n114\n00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,280\nMake sure you check out all of our stories.\n\n115\n00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,960\nKeep watching and keep reading!",
